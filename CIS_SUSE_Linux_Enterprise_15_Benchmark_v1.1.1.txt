Overview
This document provides prescriptive guidance for establishing a secure configuration
posture for SUSE Linux Enterprise 15 systems running on x86 or x64 platforms. This
document was tested against SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 SP3.

The guidance within broadly assumes that operations are being performed as the root user.
Non-root users may not be able to access certain areas of the system, especially after
remediation has been performed. It is advisable to verify root users path integrity and the
integrity of any programs being run prior to execution of commands and scripts included in
this benchmark.

To obtain the latest version of this guide, please visit the CIS SUSE Linux Enterprise Server
community . If you have questions, comments, or have identified ways to improve this
guide, please write us at feedback@cisecurity.org

Intended Audience
This benchmark is intended for system and application administrators, security specialists,
auditors, help desk, and platform deployment personnel who plan to develop, deploy,
assess, or secure solutions that incorporate SUSE Linux Enterprise 15 on a x86 or x64
platform.


Consensus Guidance
This benchmark was created using a consensus review process comprised of subject
matter experts. Consensus participants provide perspective from a diverse set of
backgrounds including consulting, software development, audit and compliance, security
research, operations, government, and legal.
Each CIS benchmark undergoes two phases of consensus review. The first phase occurs
during initial benchmark development. During this phase, subject matter experts convene
to discuss, create, and test working drafts of the benchmark. This discussion occurs until
consensus has been reached on benchmark recommendations. The second phase begins
after the benchmark has been published. During this phase, all feedback provided by the
Internet community is reviewed by the consensus team for incorporation in the
benchmark. If you are interested in participating in the consensus process, please visit
https://workbench.cisecurity.org/.

Assessment Status
An assessment status is included for every recommendation. The assessment status
indicates whether the given recommendation can be automated or requires manual steps
to implement. Both statuses are equally important and are determined and supported as
defined below:

Automated

Represents recommendations for which assessment of a technical control can be fully
automated and validated to a pass/fail state. Recommendations will include the necessary
information to implement automation.

Manual

Represents recommendations for which assessment of a technical control cannot be fully
automated and requires all or some manual steps to validate that the configured state is set
as expected. The expected state can vary depending on the environment.




                                                                                13 | P a g e

Recommendations
1 Initial Setup
Items in this section are advised for all systems, but may be difficult or require extensive
preparation after the initial setup of the system.




                                                                                   16 | P a g e
1.1 Filesystem Configuration
Directories that are used for system-wide functions can be further protected by placing
them on separate partitions. This provides protection for resource exhaustion and enables
the use of mounting options that are applicable to the directory's intended use. Users' data
can be stored on separate partitions and have stricter mount options. A user partition is a
filesystem that has been established for use by the users and does not contain software for
system operations.

The recommendations in this section are easier to perform during initial system
installation. If the system is already installed, it is recommended that a full backup be
performed before repartitioning the system.

Note: If you are repartitioning a system that has already been installed, make sure the data
has been copied over to the new partition, unmount it and then remove the data from the
directory that was in the old partition. Otherwise it will still consume space in the old
partition that will be masked when the new filesystem is mounted. For example, if a system is
in single-user mode with no filesystems mounted and the administrator adds a lot of data to
the /tmp directory, this data will still consume space in / once the /tmp filesystem is mounted
unless it is removed first.




                                                                                    17 | P a g e
1.1.1 Disable unused filesystems
A number of uncommon filesystem types are supported under Linux. Removing support for
unneeded filesystem types reduces the local attack surface of the system. If a filesystem
type is not needed it should be disabled. Native Linux file systems are designed to ensure
that built-in security controls function as expected. Non-native filesystems can lead to
unexpected consequences to both the security and functionality of the system and should
be used with caution. Many filesystems are created for niche use cases and are not
maintained and supported as the operating systems are updated and patched. Users of
non-native filesystems should ensure that there is attention and ongoing support for them,
especially in light of frequent operating system changes.

Standard network connectivity and Internet access to cloud storage may make the use of
non-standard filesystem formats to directly attach heterogeneous devices much less
attractive.

Note: This should not be considered a comprehensive list of filesystems. You may wish to
consider additions to those listed here for your environment.

1.1.1.1 Ensure mounting of squashfs filesystems is disabled (Automated)
Profile Applicability:

• Level 2 - Server
• Level 2 - Workstation

Description:

The squashfs filesystem type is a compressed read-only Linux filesystem embedded in
small footprint systems (similar to cramfs). A squashfs image can be used without having
to first decompress the image.

Rationale:

Removing support for unneeded filesystem types reduces the local attack surface of the
system. If this filesystem type is not needed, disable it.

Impact:

Disabling squashfs will prevent the use of snap. Snap is a package manager for Linux for
installing Snap packages.

"Snap" application packages of software are self-contained and work across a range of
Linux distributions. This is unlike traditional Linux package management approaches, like
APT or RPM, which require specifically adapted packages per Linux distribution on an
application update and delay therefore application deployment from developers to their
software's end-user. Snaps themselves have no dependency on any external store ("App
store"), can be obtained from any source and can be therefore used for upstream software
deployment. When snaps are deployed on versions of Linux, the Ubuntu app store is used
as default back-end, but other stores can be enabled as well.

Audit:

Run the following commands and verify the output is as indicated:

# modprobe -n -v squashfs | grep -E '(squashfs|install)'

1.1.1.2 Ensure mounting of udf filesystems is disabled (Automated)
Profile Applicability:

• Level 1 - Server
• Level 1 - Workstation

Description:

The udf filesystem type is the universal disk format used to implement ISO/IEC 13346 and
ECMA-167 specifications. This is an open vendor filesystem type for data storage on a
broad range of media. This filesystem type is necessary to support writing DVDs and newer
optical disc formats.

Rationale:

Removing support for unneeded filesystem types reduces the local attack surface of the
system. If this filesystem type is not needed, disable it.

Audit:

Run the following commands and verify the output is as indicated:

# modprobe -n -v udf | grep -E '(udf|install)'

install /bin/true

# lsmod | grep udf

<No output>

Remediation:

Edit or create a file in the /etc/modprobe.d/ directory ending in .conf
Example: vi /etc/modprobe.d/udf.conf
and add the following line:

install udf /bin/true

1.1.1.3 Ensure mounting of FAT filesystems is limited (Automated)
Profile Applicability:

• Level 2 - Workstation
• Level 2 - Server

Description:

The FAT filesystem format is primarily used on older windows systems and portable USB
drives or flash modules. It comes in three types FAT12, FAT16, and FAT32 all of which are
supported by the vfat kernel module.

Rationale:

Removing support for unneeded filesystem types reduces the local attack surface of the
system. If this filesystem type is not needed, disable it.
Notes:

   •   The FAT filesystem format is used by UEFI systems for the EFI boot partition. Disabling
       the vfat module can prevent boot on UEFI systems.
   •   FAT filesystems are often used on portable USB sticks and other flash media which are
       commonly used to transfer files between workstations, removing VFAT support may
       prevent the ability to transfer files in this way.

Impact:

Audit:

If utilizing UEFI the FAT filesystem format is required. If this case, ensure that the FAT
filesystem is only used where appropriate

Run the following command

grep -E -i '\svfat\s' /etc/fstab

And review that any output is appropriate for your environment

If not utilizing UEFI

Run the following commands and verify the output is as indicated:

# modprobe -n -v fat | grep -E '(fat|install)'

install /bin/true

# lsmod | grep fat

1.1.2 Ensure /tmp is configured (Automated)
Profile Applicability:

• Level 1 - Server
• Level 1 - Workstation

Description:

The /tmp directory is a world-writable directory used for temporary storage by all users
and some applications.
Notes:

   •   If an entry for /tmp exists in /etc/fstab it will take precedence over entries in the
       tmp.mount file.
   •   tmpfs can be resized using the size={size} parameter in /etc/fstab or on the Options
       line in the tmp.mount file. If we don't specify the size, it will be half the RAM.

Resize tmpfs examples:

   •   /etc/fstab

  tmpfs      /tmp          tmpfs    rw,noexec,nodev,nosuid,size=2G                  0   0

   •   tmp.mount

  [Mount]

  What=tmpfs

  Where=/tmp

  Type=tmpfs

  Options=mode=1777,strictatime,size=2G,noexec,nodev,nosuid

Rationale:

Making /tmp its own file system allows an administrator to set the noexec option on the
mount, making /tmp useless for an attacker to install executable code. It would also
prevent an attacker from establishing a hardlink to a system setuid program and wait for it
to be updated. Once the program was updated, the hardlink would be broken and the
attacker would have his own copy of the program. If the program happened to have a
security vulnerability, the attacker could continue to exploit the known flaw.
This can be accomplished by either mounting tmpfs to /tmp, or creating a separate
partition for /tmp.




                                                                                 26 | P a g e
Impact:

Since the /tmp directory is intended to be world-writable, there is a risk of resource
exhaustion if it is not bound to a separate partition.
Running out of /tmp space is a problem regardless of what kind of filesystem lies under it,
but in a default installation a disk-based /tmp will essentially have the whole disk available,
as it only creates a single / partition. On the other hand, a RAM-based /tmp as with tmpfs
will almost certainly be much smaller, which can lead to applications filling up the
filesystem much more easily.

Audit:

Run the following command and verify output shows /tmp is mounted:

# mount | grep -E '\s/tmp\s'

tmpfs on /tmp type tmpfs (rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime)

If /etc/fstab is used:

     •   Run the following command and verify that tmpfs has been mounted to, or a system
         partition has been created for /tmp

  # grep -E '\s/tmp\s' /etc/fstab | grep -E -v '^\s*#'

  tmpfs      /tmp     tmpfs    defaults,noexec,nosuid,nodev 0           0

OR

If systemd tmp.mount file is used:

     •   Run the following command and verify that tmp.mount is enabled:

 # systemctl is-enabled tmp.mount

 enabled




                                                                                   27 | P a g e
Remediation:

Create or update an entry for /tmp in either /etc/fstab OR in a systemd tmp.mount file:
If /etc/fstab is used:

     •   Configure /etc/fstab as appropriate.

  Example:
  tmpfs /tmp       tmpfs       defaults,rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime       0 0
     •   Run the following command to remount /tmp

  # mount -o remount,noexec,nodev,nosuid /tmp


OR

If an explicit systemd target is used to mount /tmp:

     •   Run the following command to create the file /etc/systemd/system/tmp.mount if it
         doesn't exist:

  # [ ! -f /etc/systemd/system/tmp.mount ] && cp -v
/usr/share/systemd/tmp.mount /etc/systemd/system/




                                                                               28 | P a g e

1.1.5 Ensure nosuid option set on /tmp partition (Automated)
Profile Applicability:

• Level 1 - Server
• Level 1 - Workstation

Description:

The nosuid mount option specifies that the filesystem cannot contain setuid files.

Rationale:

Since the /tmp filesystem is only intended for temporary file storage, set this option to
ensure that users cannot create setuid files in /tmp.

Audit:

Verify that the nosuid option is set if a /tmp partition exists
Run the following command and verify that nothing is returned:

# mount | grep -E '\s/tmp\s' | grep -v nosuid




                                                                                   37 | P a g e
Remediation:

If /etc/fstab is used to mount /tmp

Edit the /etc/fstab file and add nosuid to the fourth field (mounting options) for the /tmp
partition. See the fstab(5) manual page for more information.
Run the following command to remount /tmp :

# mount -o remount,nosuid /tmp

OR

If an explicit systemd target is used to mount /tmp:

Edit /etc/systemd/system/local-fs.target.wants/tmp.mount to add nosuid to the /tmp
mount options:

[Mount]
Options=mode=1777,strictatime,noexec,nodev,nosuid

Run the following command to restart the systemd daemon:

#    systemctl daemon-reload

Run the following command to restart tmp.mount:

# systemctl restart tmp.mount

Additional Information:

These remediation steps are based on following the remediation guidance in item 1.1.2.

If a different file name was used that name should replace tmp.mount in the path
/etc/systemd/system/local-fs.target.wants/tmp.mount

The contents of /etc/systemd/system/local-fs.target.wants should exist as a symlink
to the file created in /etc/systemd/system.

If the path /etc/systemd/system/local-fs.target.wants/tmp.mount does not exist this
could indicate that the remediation steps from 1.1.2 were not completed successfully.

1.1.6 Ensure /dev/shm is configured (Automated)
Profile Applicability:

• Level 1 - Server
• Level 1 - Workstation

Description:

/dev/shm is a traditional shared memory concept. One program will create a memory
portion, which other processes (if permitted) can access. If /dev/shm is not configured,
tmpfs will be mounted to /dev/shm by systemd.
Notes:

   •   An entry for /dev/shm in /etc/fstab will take precedence.
   •   tmpfs can be resized using the size={size} parameter in /etc/fstab. If we don't specify
       the size, it will be half the RAM.

Resize tmpfs example:

  tmpfs      /dev/shm     tmpfs     defaults,noexec,nodev,nosuid,size=2G         0    0

Rationale:

Any user can upload and execute files inside the /dev/shm similar to the /tmp partition.
Configuring /dev/shm allows an administrator to set the noexec option on the mount,
making /dev/shm useless for an attacker to install executable code. It would also prevent an
attacker from establishing a hardlink to a system setuid program and wait for it to be
updated. Once the program was updated, the hardlink would be broken and the attacker
would have his own copy of the program. If the program happened to have a security
vulnerability, the attacker could continue to exploit the known flaw.

Audit:

Run the following command and verify output shows /dev/shm is mounted:

# mount | grep -E '\s/dev/shm\s'

# grep -E '\s/dev/shm\s' /etc/fstab

tmpfs /dev/shm tmpfs defaults,noexec,nodev,nosuid 0 0

Remediation:

Edit /etc/fstab and add or edit the following line:

tmpfs        /dev/shm           tmpfs        defaults,noexec,nodev,nosuid                        0 0

1.1.7 Ensure noexec option set on /dev/shm partition (Automated)
Profile Applicability:

• Level 1 - Server
• Level 1 - Workstation

Description:

The noexec mount option specifies that the filesystem cannot contain executable binaries.

Note: /dev/shm is mounted automatically by systemd. /dev/shm needs to be added to
/etc/fstab to add mount options even though it is already being mounted on boot.

Rationale:

Setting this option on a file system prevents users from executing programs from shared
memory. This deters users from introducing potentially malicious software on the system.

Audit:

Run the following command to verify that the noexec option is set:

# mount | grep -E '\s/dev/shm\s' | grep -v noexec

Nothing should be returned

Description:

The nosuid mount option specifies that the filesystem cannot contain setuid files.

Note: /dev/shm is mounted automatically by systemd. /dev/shm needs to be added to
/etc/fstab to add mount options even though it is already being mounted on boot.

Rationale:

Setting this option on a file system prevents users from introducing privileged programs

1.1.10 Ensure separate partition exists for /var (Automated)
Profile Applicability:

• Level 2 - Server
• Level 2 - Workstation

Description:

The /var directory is used by daemons and other system services to temporarily store
dynamic data. Some directories created by these processes may be world-writable.

Note: When modifying /var it is advisable to bring the system to emergency mode (so auditd
is not running), rename the existing directory, mount the new file system, and migrate the
data over before returning to multiuser mode.

Rationale:

Since the /var directory may contain world-writable files and directories, there is a risk of
resource exhaustion if it is not bound to a separate partition.

Impact:

Resizing filesystems is a common activity in cloud-hosted servers. Separate filesystem
partitions may prevent successful resizing, or may require the installation of additional
tools solely for the purpose of resizing operations. The use of these additional tools may
introduce their own security considerations.

Audit:

Run the following command and verify output shows /var is mounted:

# mount | grep -E '\s/var\s'

/dev/xvdg1 on /var type ext4 (rw,relatime,data=ordered)

Remediation:

For new installations, during installation create a custom partition setup and specify a
separate partition for /var .

For systems that were previously installed, create a new partition and configure
/etc/fstab as appropriate.

1.1.11 Ensure separate partition exists for /var/tmp (Automated)
Profile Applicability:

• Level 2 - Server
• Level 2 - Workstation

Description:

The /var/tmp directory is a world-writable directory used for temporary storage by all
users and some applications and is intended for temporary files that are preserved across
reboots.

Note: tmpfs should not be used for /var/tmp/. tmpfs is a temporary filesystem that resides in
memory and/or swap partition(s). Files in tmpfs are automatically cleared at each bootup.

Rationale:

Since the /var/tmp directory is intended to be world-writable, there is a risk of resource
exhaustion if it is not bound to a separate partition. In addition, making /var/tmp its own
file system allows an administrator to set the noexec option on the mount, making
/var/tmp useless for an attacker to install executable code. It would also prevent an
attacker from establishing a hardlink to a system setuid program and wait for it to be
updated. Once the program was updated, the hardlink would be broken and the attacker
would have his own copy of the program. If the program happened to have a security
vulnerability, the attacker could continue to exploit the known flaw.

Impact:

Resizing filesystems is a common activity in cloud-hosted servers. Separate filesystem
partitions may prevent successful resizing, or may require the installation of additional
tools solely for the purpose of resizing operations. The use of these additional tools may
introduce their own security considerations.

1.1.15 Ensure separate partition exists for /var/log (Automated)
Profile Applicability:

• Level 2 - Server
• Level 2 - Workstation

Description:

The /var/log directory is used by system services to store log data.

Rationale:

There are two important reasons to ensure that system logs are stored on a separate
partition: protection against resource exhaustion (since logs can grow quite large) and
protection of audit data.

Note: When modifying /var/log it is advisable to bring the system to emergency mode (so
auditd is not running), rename the existing directory, mount the new file system, and migrate
the data over before returning to multiuser mode.

Impact:

Resizing filesystems is a common activity in cloud-hosted servers. Separate filesystem
partitions may prevent successful resizing, or may require the installation of additional
tools solely for the purpose of resizing operations. The use of these additional tools may
introduce their own security considerations.

Audit:

Run the following command and verify output shows /var/log is mounted:

# mount | grep -E '\s/var/log\s'

<device> on /var/log type ext4 (rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime)

Remediation:

For new installations, during installation create a custom partition setup and specify a
separate partition for /var/log .

For systems that were previously installed, create a new partition and configure
/etc/fstab as appropriate.

1.1.16 Ensure separate partition exists for /var/log/audit (Automated)
Profile Applicability:

• Level 2 - Server
• Level 2 - Workstation

Description:

The auditing daemon, auditd , stores log data in the /var/log/audit directory.

Note: When modifying /var/log/audit it is advisable to bring the system to emergency mode
(so auditd is not running), rename the existing directory, mount the new file system, and
migrate the data over before returning to multiuser mode.

Rationale:

There are two important reasons to ensure that data gathered by auditd is stored on a
separate partition: protection against resource exhaustion (since the audit.log file can
grow quite large) and protection of audit data. The audit daemon calculates how much free
space is left and performs actions based on the results. If other processes (such as syslog )
consume space in the same partition as auditd , it may not perform as desired.

Impact:

Resizing filesystems is a common activity in cloud-hosted servers. Separate filesystem
partitions may prevent successful resizing, or may require the installation of additional
tools solely for the purpose of resizing operations. The use of these additional tools may
introduce their own security considerations.

Audit:

Run the following command and verify output shows /var/log/audit is mounted:

# mount | grep /var/log/audit

/dev/xvdi1 on /var/log/audit type ext4 (rw,relatime,data=ordered)

Remediation:

For new installations, during installation create a custom partition setup and specify a
separate partition for /var/log/audit .

For systems that were previously installed, create a new partition and configure
/etc/fstab as appropriate.

1.1.18 Ensure nodev option set on /home partition (Automated)
Profile Applicability:

• Level 1 - Server
• Level 1 - Workstation

Description:

The nodev mount option specifies that the filesystem cannot contain special devices.

Note: The actions in this recommendation refer to the /home partition, which is the default
user partition. If you have created other user partitions, it is recommended that the
Remediation and Audit steps be applied to these partitions as well.

Rationale:

Since the user partitions are not intended to support devices, set this option to ensure that
users cannot attempt to create block or character special devices.

Audit:

If a /home partition exists:

Run the following command to verify that that the nodev option is set:

# mount | grep -E '\s/home\s' | grep -v nodev

Nothing should be returned

Remediation:

Edit the /etc/fstab file and add nodev to the fourth field (mounting options) for the /home
partition. See the fstab(5) manual page for more information.

Run the following command to remount /home/ with the nodev mount option:

# mount -o remount,nodev /home

1.1.19 Ensure noexec option set on removable media partitions
(Manual)
Profile Applicability:

• Level 1 - Server
• Level 1 - Workstation

Description:

The noexec mount option specifies that the filesystem cannot contain executable binaries.

Rationale:

Setting this option on a file system prevents users from executing programs from the
removable media. This deters users from being able to introduce potentially malicious
software on the system.

Audit:

Run the following command and verify that the noexec option is set on all removable media
partitions.

# mount

Remediation:

Edit the /etc/fstab file and add noexec to the fourth field (mounting options) of all
removable media partitions. Look for entries that have mount points that contain words
such as floppy or cdrom. See the fstab(5) manual page for more information.

1.1.20 Ensure nodev option set on removable media partitions (Manual)
Profile Applicability:

• Level 1 - Server

Description:

The nodev mount option specifies that the filesystem cannot contain special devices.

Rationale:

Removable media containing character and block special devices could be used to
circumvent security controls by allowing non-root users to access sensitive device files
such as /dev/kmem or the raw disk partitions.

Audit:

Run the following command and verify that the nodev option is set on all removable media
partitions.

# mount

Remediation:

Edit the /etc/fstab file and add nodev to the fourth field (mounting options) of all

1.1.22 Ensure sticky bit is set on all world-writable directories
(Automated)
Profile Applicability:

• Level 1 - Server
• Level 1 - Workstation

Description:

Setting the sticky bit on world writable directories prevents users from deleting or
renaming files in that directory that are not owned by them.

Rationale:

This feature prevents the ability to delete or rename files in world writable directories
(such as /tmp ) that are owned by another user.

Audit:

Run the following command to verify no world writable directories exist without the sticky
bit set:

# df --local -P 2> /dev/null | awk '{if (NR!=1) print $6}' | xargs -I '{}'
find '{}' -xdev -type d \( -perm -0002 -a ! -perm -1000 \) 2>/dev/null

No output should be returned.

Remediation:

Run the following command to set the sticky bit on all world writable directories:

# df --local -P | awk '{if (NR!=1) print $6}' | xargs -I '{}' find '{}' -xdev

1.1.23 Disable Automounting (Automated)
Profile Applicability:

• Level 1 - Server
• Level 2 - Workstation

Description:

autofs allows automatic mounting of devices, typically including CD/DVDs and USB drives.

Notes:

   •     Additional methods of disabling a service exist. Consult your distribution
         documentation for appropriate methods.
   •     This control should align with the tolerance of the use of portable drives and optical
         media in the organization.
            o On a server requiring an admin to manually mount media can be part of
                defense-in-depth to reduce the risk of unapproved software or information
                being introduced or proprietary software or information being exfiltrated.
            o If admins commonly use flash drives and Server access has sufficient physical
                controls, requiring manual mounting may not increase security.

Rationale:

With automounting enabled anyone with physical access could attach a USB drive or disc
and have its contents available in system even if they lacked permissions to mount it
themselves.

Impact:

The use of portable hard drives is very common for workstation users. If your organization
allows the use of portable storage or media on workstations and physical access controls to
workstations is considered adequate there is little value add in turning off automounting.

Audit:

Run the following command to verify autofs is not enabled:

# systemctl is-enabled autofs

Verify result is not enabled.




                                                                                     72 | P a g e

1.2 Configure Software Updates
Most distributions use a package manager such as yum, apt, or zypper to install and update
software packages. Patch management procedures may vary widely between enterprises.
Large enterprises may choose to install a local updates server that can be used in place of
their distributions servers, whereas a single deployment of a system may prefer to get
updates directly. Updates can be performed automatically or manually, depending on the
site's policy for patch management. Many large enterprises prefer to test patches on a non-
production system before rolling out to production.

For the purpose of this benchmark, the requirement is to ensure that a patch management
system is configured and maintained. The specifics on patch update procedures are left to
the organization.




                                                                                74 | P a g e
1.2.1 Ensure GPG keys are configured (Manual)
Profile Applicability:

Description:

Most packages managers implement GPG key signing to verify package integrity during
installation.

Rationale:

It is important to ensure that updates are obtained from a valid source to protect against
spoofing that could lead to the inadvertent installation of malware on the system.

Audit:

Verify GPG keys are configured correctly for your package manager. Depending on the
package management in use one of the following command groups may provide the needed
information:

# rpm -q gpg-pubkey --qf '%{name}-%{version}-%{release} --> %{summary}\n'

Remediation:

Update your package manager GPG keys in accordance with site policy.

"does not have gpgcheck enabled." }' /etc/zypp/repos.d/*.repo

Remediation:

Edit /etc/zypp/zypp.conf and set 'gpgcheck=1' in the [main] section.

Edit any failing files in /etc/zypp/repos.d/*.repo and set all instances of gpgcheck to 1.

1.3 Configure sudo
sudo allows a permitted user to execute a command as the superuser or another user, as
specified by the security policy. The invoking user's real (not effective) user ID is used to
determine the user name with which to query the security policy.

sudo supports a plugin architecture for security policies and input/output logging. Third
parties can develop and distribute their own policy and I/O logging plugins to work
seamlessly with the sudo front end. The default security policy is sudoers, which is
configured via the file /etc/sudoers.

The security policy determines what privileges, if any, a user has to run sudo. The policy
may require that users authenticate themselves with a password or another authentication
mechanism. If authentication is required, sudo will exit if the user's password is not
entered within a configurable time limit. This limit is policy-specific.

1.3.2 Ensure sudo commands use pty (Automated)
Profile Applicability:

• Level 1 - Server
• Level 1 - Workstation

Description:

sudo can be configured to run only from a pseudo-pty

Note: visudo edits the sudoers file in a safe fashion, analogous to vipw(8). visudo locks the
sudoers file against multiple simultaneous edits, provides basic sanity checks, and checks for
parse errors. If the sudoers file is currently being edited you will receive a message to try
again later. The -f option allows you to tell visudo which file to edit.

Rationale:

Attackers can run a malicious program using sudo, which would again fork a background
process that remains even when the main program has finished executing.

This can be mitigated by configuring sudo to run other commands only from a pseudo-pty,
whether I/O logging is turned on or not.

Audit:

Run the following command to verify that sudo can only run other commands from a
pseudo-pty:

# grep -Ei '^\s*Defaults\s+([^#]\S+,\s*)?use_pty\b' /etc/sudoers

1.4 Filesystem Integrity Checking
AIDE is a file integrity checking tool, similar in nature to Tripwire. While it cannot prevent
intrusions, it can detect unauthorized changes to configuration files by alerting when the
files are changed. When setting up AIDE, decide internally what the site policy will be
concerning integrity checking. Review the AIDE quick start guide and AIDE documentation
before proceeding.




                                                                                   86 | P a g e
1.4.1 Ensure AIDE is installed (Automated)
Profile Applicability:

• Level 1 - Server
• Level 1 - Workstation

Description:

AIDE takes a snapshot of filesystem state including modification times, permissions, and
file hashes which can then be used to compare against the current state of the filesystem to
detect modifications to the system.

Note: The prelinking feature can interfere with AIDE because it alters binaries to speed up
their start up times. Run prelink -ua to restore the binaries to their prelinked state, thus
avoiding false positives from AIDE.

Rationale:

By monitoring the filesystem state compromised files can be detected to prevent or limit
the exposure of accidental or malicious misconfigurations or modified binaries.

Audit:

Run the following command and verify aide is installed:

# rpm -q aide

aide-<version>

Remediation:

Configure AIDE as appropriate for your environment. Consult the AIDE documentation for
options.

Run the following command to install AIDE:

# zypper install aide

Run the following commands to initialize AIDE:

# aide --init

# mv /var/lib/aide/aide.db.new /var/lib/aide/aide.db

1.4.2 Ensure filesystem integrity is regularly checked (Automated)
Profile Applicability:

• Level 1 - Server

Description:

Periodic checking of the filesystem integrity is needed to detect changes to the filesystem.

Note: The checking in this recommendation occurs every day at 5am. Alter the frequency and
time of the checks in compliance with site policy.

Rationale:

Periodic file checking allows the system administrator to determine on a regular basis if
critical files have been changed in an unauthorized fashion.

Audit:

Run the following commands to determine if there is a cron job scheduled to run the aide
check.

# crontab -u root -l | grep aide
# grep -r aide /etc/cron.* /etc/crontab

Ensure a cron job in compliance with site policy is returned.

# systemctl is-enabled aidecheck.service

# systemctl is-enabled aidecheck.timer
# systemctl status aidecheck.timer

1.5.1 Ensure bootloader password is set (Automated)
Profile Applicability:

• Level 1 - Server
• Level 1 - Workstation

Description:

Setting the boot loader password will require that anyone rebooting the system must enter
a password before being able to set command line boot parameters

Notes:

   •     This recommendation is designed around the grub2 bootloader, if LILO or another
         bootloader is in use in your environment enact equivalent settings. Replace
         `/boot/grub2/grub.cfg with the appropriate grub configuration file for your
         environment
   •     The information can be placed in any /etc/grub.d file as long as that file is
         incorporated into grub.cfg
             o The superuser/user information and password should not be contained in the
                /etc/grub.d/00_header file.
             o A custom file, such as /etc/grub.d/40_custom should be used so it is not
                overwritten should the Grub package be updated.

Rationale:

Requiring a boot password upon execution of the boot loader will prevent an unauthorized
user from entering boot parameters or changing the boot partition. This prevents users
from weakening security (e.g. turning off SELinux at boot time).

Impact:

   •     If password protection is enabled, only the designated superuser can edit a Grub 2
         menu item by pressing "e" or access the GRUB 2 command line by pressing "c"
   •     If GRUB 2 is set up to boot automatically to a password-protected menu entry the
         user has no option to back out of the password prompt to select another menu
         entry. Holding the SHIFT key will not display the menu in this case. The user must
         enter the correct username and password. If unable, the configuration files will have
         to be edited via the LiveCD or other means to fix the problem
   •     You can add --unrestricted to the menu entries to allow the system to boot without
         entering a password. Password will still be required to edit menu items.

Audit:

Run the following commands:

# grep "^\s*set superusers" /boot/grub2/grub.cfg

set superusers="<username>"

# grep "^\s*password" /boot/grub2/grub.cfg

password_pbkdf2 <username> <encrypted-password>

Remediation:

create an encrypted password with grub2-mkpasswd-pbkdf2:

# grub2-mkpasswd-pbkdf2

Enter password: <password>
Reenter password: <password>

Your PBKDF2 is <encrypted-password>

Add the following into /etc/grub.d/40_custom

set superusers="<username>"
password_pbkdf2 <username> <encrypted-password>

Run the following command to update the grub2 configuration:

1.5.2 Ensure permissions on bootloader config are configured
(Automated)
Profile Applicability:

• Level 1 - Server
• Level 1 - Workstation

Description:

The grub configuration file contains information on boot settings and passwords for
unlocking boot options. The grub2 configuration is usually grub.cfg stored in
/boot/grub2/.

Notes:

   •     This recommendation is designed around the grub2 bootloader.
   •     If LILO or another bootloader is in use in your environment:
             o Enact equivalent settings
             o Replace /boot/grub2/grub.cfg and /boot/grub2/user.cfg with the
                 appropriate boot configuration files for your environment

Rationale:

Setting the permissions to read and write for root only prevents non-root users from
seeing the boot parameters or changing them. Non-root users who read the boot
parameters may be able to identify weaknesses in security upon boot and be able to exploit
them.

Audit:

Run the following command and verify Uid and Gid are 0/root and Access does not grant
permissions to group or other :

# stat /boot/grub2/grub.cfg

Access: (0600/-rw-------)      Uid: (     0/     root)     Gid: (     0/     root)




                                                                               96 | P a g e
Remediation:

Run the following commands to set ownership and permissions on your grub
configuration:

# chown root:root /boot/grub2/grub.cfg

# chmod og-rwx /boot/grub2/grub.cfg

1.5.3 Ensure authentication required for single user mode (Automated)
Profile Applicability:

• Level 1 - Server
• Level 1 - Workstation

Description:

Single user mode (rescue mode) is used for recovery when the system detects an issue
during boot or by manual selection from the bootloader.

Rationale:

Requiring authentication in single user mode (rescue mode) prevents an unauthorized user
from rebooting the system into single user to gain root privileges without credentials.

Audit:

Run the following commands and verify that /sbin/sulogin or /usr/sbin/sulogin is used
as shown:

# grep /systemd-sulogin-shell /usr/lib/systemd/system/rescue.service

ExecStart=-/usr/lib/systemd/systemd-sulogin-shell rescue

# grep /systemd-sulogin-shell /usr/lib/systemd/system/emergency.service

ExecStart=-/usr/lib/systemd/systemd-sulogin-shell emergency

Remediation:

Edit /usr/lib/systemd/system/rescue.service and add/modify the following line:

ExecStart=-/usr/lib/systemd/systemd-sulogin-shell rescue

1.6.1 Ensure core dumps are restricted (Automated)
Profile Applicability:

• Level 1 - Server
• Level 1 - Workstation

Description:

A core dump is the memory of an executable program. It is generally used to determine
why a program aborted. It can also be used to glean confidential information from a core
file. The system provides the ability to set a soft limit for core dumps, but this can be
overridden by the user.

Rationale:

Setting a hard limit on core dumps prevents users from overriding the soft variable. If core
dumps are required, consider setting limits for user groups (see limits.conf(5) ). In
addition, setting the fs.suid_dumpable variable to 0 will prevent setuid programs from
dumping core.

Audit:

Run the following commands and verify output matches:

# grep -E "^\s*\*\s+hard\s+core" /etc/security/limits.conf
/etc/security/limits.d/*

* hard core 0

# sysctl fs.suid_dumpable

fs.suid_dumpable = 0

# grep "fs\.suid_dumpable" /etc/sysctl.conf /etc/sysctl.d/*

fs.suid_dumpable = 0

Run the following command to check if systemd-coredump is installed:

# systemctl is-enabled coredump.service

if enabled or disabled is returned systemd-coredump is installed




                                                                                101 | P a g e
Remediation:

Add the following line to /etc/security/limits.conf or a /etc/security/limits.d/*
file:

* hard core 0

Set the following parameter in /etc/sysctl.conf or a /etc/sysctl.d/* file:

fs.suid_dumpable = 0

Run the following command to set the active kernel parameter:

# sysctl -w fs.suid_dumpable=0

If systemd-coredump is installed:
edit /etc/systemd/coredump.conf and add/modify the following lines:

Storage=none
ProcessSizeMax=0

Run the command:

1.6.2 Ensure XD/NX support is enabled (Automated)
Profile Applicability:

• Level 1 - Server
• Level 1 - Workstation

Description:

Recent processors in the x86 family support the ability to prevent code execution on a per
memory page basis. Generically and on AMD processors, this ability is called No Execute
(NX), while on Intel processors it is called Execute Disable (XD). This ability can help
prevent exploitation of buffer overflow vulnerabilities and should be activated whenever
possible. Extra steps must be taken to ensure that this protection is enabled, particularly on
32-bit x86 systems. Other processors, such as Itanium and POWER, have included such
support since inception and the standard kernel for those platforms supports the feature.

Rationale:

Enabling any feature that can protect against buffer overflow attacks enhances the security
of the system.

Note: Ensure your system supports the XD or NX bit and has PAE support before implementing
this recommendation as this may prevent it from booting if these are not supported by your
hardware.

Audit:

Run the following command and verify your kernel has identified and activated NX/XD
protection.

# journalctl | grep 'protection: active'

kernel: NX (Execute Disable) protection: active

OR

On systems without journalctl:

# [[ -n $(grep noexec[0-9]*=off /proc/cmdline) || -z $(grep -E -i ' (pae|nx)
' /proc/cpuinfo) || -n $(grep '\sNX\s.*\sprotection:\s' /var/log/dmesg | grep
-v active) ]] && echo "NX Protection is not active"

Nothing should be returned




                                                                                103 | P a g e
Remediation:

On 32 bit systems install a kernel with PAE support, no installation is required on 64 bit
systems:

If necessary configure your bootloader to load the new kernel and reboot the system.
You may need to enable NX or XD support in your bios.

Description:

Address space layout randomization (ASLR) is an exploit mitigation technique which
randomly arranges the address space of key data areas of a process.

Rationale:

Randomly placing virtual memory regions will make it difficult to write memory page
exploits as the memory placement will be consistently shifting.

Description:

prelink   is a program that modifies ELF shared libraries and ELF dynamically linked
binaries in such a way that the time needed for the dynamic linker to perform relocations

1.7 Mandatory Access Control
Mandatory Access Control (MAC) provides an additional layer of access restrictions to
processes on top of the base Discretionary Access Controls. By restricting how processes
can access files and resources on a system the potential impact from vulnerabilities in the
processes can be reduced.

Impact: Mandatory Access Control limits the capabilities of applications and daemons on a
system, while this can prevent unauthorized access the configuration of MAC can be complex
and difficult to implement correctly preventing legitimate access from occurring.

1.7.1 Configure AppArmor
AppArmor provides a Mandatory Access Control (MAC) system that greatly augments the
default Discretionary Access Control (DAC) model. Under AppArmor MAC rules are applied
by file paths instead of by security contexts as in other MAC systems. As such it does not
require support in the filesystem and can be applied to network mounted filesystems for
example. AppArmor security policies define what system resources applications can access
and what privileges they can do so with. This automatically limits the damage that the
software can do to files accessible by the calling user. The user does not need to take any
action to gain this benefit. For an action to occur, both the traditional DAC permissions
must be satisfied as well as the AppArmor MAC rules. The action will not be allowed if
either one of these models does not permit the action. In this way, AppArmor rules can only
make a system's permissions more restrictive and secure.

1.7.1.1 Ensure AppArmor is installed (Automated)
Profile Applicability:

• Level 1 - Server
• Level 1 - Workstation

Description:

AppArmor provides Mandatory Access Controls.

Rationale:

Without a Mandatory Access Control system installed only the default Discretionary Access
Control system will be available.

Audit:

Run the following command to verify that the AppArmor packages are installed:

# rpm -q apparmor-docs apparmor-parser apparmor-profiles apparmor-utils
libapparmor1

apparmor-docs-<version>
apparmor-parser-<version>
apparmor-profiles-<version>
apparmor-utils-<version>
libapparmor1-<version>

Remediation:

Run the following command to install AppArmor:

# zypper install -t pattern apparmor

Default Value:

AppArmor is installed on SLES 15 SP1 by default




                                                                                111 | P a g e

1.7.1.2 Ensure AppArmor is enabled in the bootloader configuration
(Automated)
Profile Applicability:

• Level 1 - Server
• Level 1 - Workstation

Description:

Configure AppArmor to be enabled at boot time and verify that it has not been overwritten
by the bootloader boot parameters.

Note: This recommendation is designed around the grub2 bootloader, if LILO or another
bootloader is in use in your environment enact equivalent settings.

Rationale:

AppArmor must be enabled at boot time in your bootloader configuration to ensure that
the controls it provides are not overridden.

Audit:

Run the following commands to verify that all linux lines have the apparmor=1 and
security=apparmor parameters set:

# grep "^\s*linux" /boot/grub2/grub.cfg | grep -v "apparmor=1"

Nothing should be returned

# grep "^\s*linux" /boot/grub2/grub.cfg | grep -v "security=apparmor"

Nothing should be returned

Remediation:

Edit /etc/default/grub and add the apparmor=1 and security=apparmor parameters to
the GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX= line

GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="apparmor=1 security=apparmor"

Run the following command to update the grub2 configuration:

# grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg




                                                                              113 | P a g e

1.8 Warning Banners
Presenting a warning message prior to the normal user login may assist in the prosecution
of trespassers on the computer system. Changing some of these login banners also has the
side effect of hiding OS version information and other detailed system information from
attackers attempting to target specific exploits at a system.

Guidelines published by the US Department of Defense require that warning messages
include at least the name of the organization that owns the system, the fact that the system
is subject to monitoring and that such monitoring is in compliance with local statutes, and
that use of the system implies consent to such monitoring. It is important that the
organization's legal counsel review the content of all messages before any system
modifications are made, as these warning messages are inherently site-specific. More
information (including citations of relevant case law) can be found at
http://www.justice.gov/criminal/cybercrime/

Note: The text provided in the remediation actions for these items is intended as an example
only. Please edit to include the specific text for your organization as approved by your legal
department.

standard command line logins for both local and remote users.




                                                                          120 | P a g e
1.8.1.1 Ensure message of the day is configured properly (Automated)
Profile Applicability:

• Level 1 - Server
• Level 1 - Workstation

Description:

The contents of the /etc/motd file are displayed to users after login and function as a
message of the day for authenticated users.

Unix-based systems have typically displayed information about the OS release and patch
level upon logging in to the system. This information can be useful to developers who are
developing software for a particular OS platform. If mingetty(8) supports the following
options, they display operating system information: \m - machine architecture \r -
operating system release \s - operating system name \v - operating system version

Rationale:

Warning messages inform users who are attempting to login to the system of their legal
status regarding the system and must include the name of the organization that owns the
system and any monitoring policies that are in place. Displaying OS and patch level
information in login banners also has the side effect of providing detailed system
information to attackers attempting to target specific exploits of a system. Authorized users
can easily get this information by running the " uname -a " command once they have logged
in.

Audit:

Run the following command and verify that the contents match site policy:

# cat /etc/motd

Run the following command and verify no results are returned:

# grep -E -i "(\\\v|\\\r|\\\m|\\\s|$(grep '^ID=' /etc/os-release | cut -d= -
f2 | sed -e 's/"//g'))" /etc/motd

Remediation:

Edit the /etc/motd file with the appropriate contents according to your site policy, remove
any instances of \m , \r , \s , \v or references to the OS platform

OR

If the motd is not used, this file can be removed.
Run the following command to remove the motd file:

# rm /etc/motd

1.9 Ensure updates, patches, and additional security software are
installed (Manual)
Profile Applicability:

• Level 1 - Server

Description:

Periodically patches are released for included software either due to security flaws or to
include additional functionality.

Note: Site policy may mandate a testing period before install onto production systems for
available updates.

Rationale:

Newer patches may contain security enhancements that would not be available through the
latest full update. As a result, it is recommended that the latest software patches be used to
take advantage of the latest functionality. As with any software installation, organizations
need to determine if a given update meets their requirements and verify the compatibility
and supportability of any additional software against the update revision that is selected.

Audit:

Run the following command and verify there are no updates or patches to install:

# zypper list-updates

Remediation:

Use your package manager to update all packages on the system according to site policy.
The following command will install all available updates:

# zypper update

1.10 Ensure GDM is removed or login is configured (Automated)
Profile Applicability:

• Level 1 - Server
• Level 1 - Workstation

Description:

The GNOME Display Manager (GDM) handles graphical login for GNOME based systems.
Configuration of the GNOME desktop is managed with dconf. It is a hierarchically
structured database or registry that allows users to modify their personal settings, and
system administrators to set default or mandatory values for all users.

Global dconf configuration parameters can be set in the /etc/dconf/db/ directory. This
includes the configuration for GDM or locking certain configuration options for users.

Rationale:

If a graphical login is not required, it should be removed to reduce the attack surface of the
system.

If a graphical login is required, last logged in user display should be disabled, and a warning
banner should be configured.

Displaying the last logged in user eliminates half of the Userid/Password equation that an
unauthorized person would need to log on.

Warning messages inform users who are attempting to login to the system of their legal
status regarding the system and must include the name of the organization that owns the
system and any monitoring policies that are in place.

Notes:

   •     This recommendation is based on the gdm profile. If a different profile name is used on
         the system, update the gdm and gdm.d to <profilee_name> and <profile_name>.d
   •     Additional options and sections may appear in the /etc/dconf/db/gdm.d/01-banner-
         message and/or /etc/dconf/db/gdm.d/00-login-screen file.
   •     If a different GUI login service is in use and required on the system, consult your
         documentation to disable displaying the last logged on user and apply an equivalent
         banner.




                                                                                  132 | P a g e
Audit:

Run the following command to verify the GDM is not installed on the system:

# rpm -q gdm

package gdm is not installed

OR

If GDM is required:
Verify that /etc/dconf/profile/gdm exists and includes the following:

user-db:user
system-db:gdm
file-db:/usr/share/gdm/greeter-dconf-defaults

Verify that a file exists in /etc/dconf/db/gdm.d/ and includes the following: (This is
typically /etc/dconf/db/gdm.d/01-banner-message)

[org/gnome/login-screen]
banner-message-enable=true
banner-message-text='<banner message>'

Verify that a file exists in /etc/dconf/db/gdm.d/ and includes the following: (This is
typically /etc/dconf/db/gdm.d/00-login-screen)

[org/gnome/login-screen]
disable-user-list=true




                                                                                133 | P a g e
Remediation:

Run the following command to remove GDM

# zypper remove gdm

OR

If GDM is required:
Edit or create the gdm profile which contains the following lines: (This is typically
/etc/dconf/profile/gdm)

user-db:user
system-db:gdm
file-db:/usr/share/gdm/greeter-dconf-defaults

Run the following Run to display a login banner:

Note: the directory /etc/dconf/db/gdm.d/ may need to be created

Edit or create a gdm keyfile for machine-wide settings: (This is typically
/etc/dconf/db/gdm.d/01-banner-message)

[org/gnome/login-screen]
banner-message-enable=true
banner-message-text='<banner message>'

Example Banner Text: 'Authorized uses only. All activity may be monitored and reported.'

Run the following to disable the user list:

Edit or create a gdm keyfile for machine-wide settings in the directory
/etc/dconf/db/gdm.d/ and add the following: (This is typically /etc/dconf/db/gdm.d/00-
login-screen)

[org/gnome/login-screen]
# Do not show the user list
disable-user-list=true

Run the following command to update the system databases:

# dconf update

2 Services
While applying system updates and patches helps correct known vulnerabilities, one of the
best ways to protect the system against as yet unreported vulnerabilities is to disable all
services that are not required for normal system operation. This prevents the exploitation
of vulnerabilities discovered at a later date. If a service is not enabled, it cannot be
exploited. The actions in this section of the document provide guidance on some services
which can be safely disabled and under which circumstances, greatly reducing the number
of possible threats to the resulting system. Additionally, some services which should
remain enabled but with secure configuration are covered as well as insecure service
clients.




                                                                              136 | P a g e
2.1 inetd Services
inetd is a super-server daemon that provides internet services and passes connections to
configured services. While not commonly used inetd and any unneeded inetd based
services should be disabled if possible.




                                                                             137 | P a g e

Description:

The eXtended InterNET Daemon ( xinetd ) is an open source super daemon that replaced
the original inetd daemon. The xinetd daemon listens for well known services and
dispatches the appropriate daemon to properly respond to service requests.

Rationale:

If there are no xinetd services required, it is recommended that the package be removed to
reduce the attack surface are of the system.

Note: If an xinetd service or services are required, ensure that any xinetd service not required
is stopped and disabled

Audit:

Run the following command to verify xinetd is not installed:

# rpm -q xinetd

package xinetd is not installed

Remediation:

2.2 Special Purpose Services
This section describes services that are installed on systems that specifically need to run
these services. If any of these services are not required, it is recommended that the package
be removed, or the service be stopped and masked to reduce the potential attack surface.




                                                                                140 | P a g e
2.2.1 Time Synchronization
It is recommended that physical systems and virtual guests lacking direct access to the
physical host's clock be configured to synchronize their time using a service such as chrony
or timesyncd.




                                                                               141 | P a g e
2.2.1.1 Ensure time synchronization is in use (Automated)
Profile Applicability:

• Level 1 - Server
• Level 1 - Workstation

Description:

System time should be synchronized between all systems in an environment. This is
typically done by establishing an authoritative time server or set of servers and having all
systems synchronize their clocks to them.

Notes:

     •   On systems where host based time synchronization is not available, verify that chrony
         is installed or systemd-timesyncd is enabled.
     •   On systems where host based time synchronization is available consult your
         documentation and verify that host based synchronization is in use.
     •   If another method for time synchronization is being used, this section may be skipped.

Rationale:

Time synchronization is important to support time sensitive security mechanisms like
Kerberos and also ensures log files have consistent time records across the enterprise,
which aids in forensic investigations.

Audit:

On systems where host based time synchronization is not available, verify chrony is
installed OR systemd-timesyncd is enabled:

Note: Only one time synchronization package should be installed and/or enabled
Run the following command to verify that chrony is installed:

# rpm -q chrony

chrony-<version>

OR

Run the following command to verify that systemd-timesyncd is enabled:

# systemctl is-enabled systemd-timesyncd




                                                                                   142 | P a g e
Remediation:

On systems where host based time synchronization is not available, install chrony OR
enable systemd-timesyncd:

Run the following command to install chrony:

# zypper install chrony

OR

Run the following command to enable systemd-timesyncd

# systemctl enable systemd-timesyncd

Note: On systems where host based time synchronization is available consult your
virtualization software documentation and setup host based synchronization.

2.2.1.2 Ensure systemd-timesyncd is configured (Manual)
Profile Applicability:

• Level 1 - Server
• Level 1 - Workstation

Description:

systemd-timesyncd is a daemon that has been added for synchronizing the system clock
across the network.
The systemd-timesyncd daemon:

   •     Implements an SNTP client.
   •     Only implements a client side
             o Does not bother with the full NTP complexity
             o Only on querys time from one remote server, synchronizing the local clock to
                 it
   •     runs with minimal privileges
   •     saves the current clock to disk every time a new NTP sync has been acquired
             o Uses this to correct the system clock early at bootup
             o to make sure that time monotonically progresses on these systems, even if it
                 is not always correct
   •     Requires a new system user and group "systemd-timesync" to be created on
         installation of systemd
   •     Hooked up with networkd to only operate when network connectivity is available

Notes:

   •     The systemd-timesyncd service specifically implements only SNTP. This minimalistic
         service will set the system clock for large offsets or slowly adjust it for smaller deltas.
         More complex use cases are not covered by systemd-timesyncd.
   •     This recommendation only applies if timesyncd is in use on the system

Rationale:

Proper configuration is vital to ensuring time synchronization is working properly.




                                                                                        144 | P a g e
Audit:

Ensure that timesyncd is enabled and started

Run the following command to verify that systemd-timesyncd is enabled:

# systemctl is-enabled systemd-timesyncd.service

enabled

Review /etc/systemd/timesyncd.conf and ensure that the NTP servers, NTP FallbackNTP
servers, and RootDistanceMaxSec listed are in accordance with local policy

Run the following command

# timedatectl status

This should return something similar to:

      Local time: Tue 2019-06-04 15:40:45 EDT
  Universal time: Tue 2019-06-04 19:40:45 UTC

                  Sun 2019-11-03 01:00:00 EST

Remediation:

Edit the file /etc/systemd/timesyncd.conf and add/modify the following lines:

NTP=0.suse.pool.ntp.org 1.suse.pool.ntp.org #Servers listed should be In
Accordance With Local Policy

FallbackNTP=2.suse.pool.ntp.org 3.suse.pool.ntp.org #Servers listed should be

2.2.1.3 Ensure chrony is configured (Automated)
Profile Applicability:

• Level 1 - Server
• Level 1 - Workstation

Description:

chrony is a daemon which implements the Network Time Protocol (NTP) and is designed to
synchronize system clocks across a variety of systems and use a source that is highly
accurate. More information on chrony can be found at: http://chrony.tuxfamily.org/.
chrony can be configured to be a client and/or a server.

Rationale:

If chrony is in use on the system proper configuration is vital to ensuring time
synchronization is working properly.

Note: This recommendation only applies if chrony is in use on the system. If another method of
time synchronization is in use on the system, this recommendation can be skipped.

Audit:

Run the following command and verify remote server is configured properly:

# grep -E "^(server|pool)" /etc/chrony.conf

server <remote-server>

Multiple servers may be configured

Run the following command and verify OPTIONS includes '-u chrony':

# grep ^OPTIONS /etc/sysconfig/chronyd

OPTIONS="-u chrony"

Additional options may be present.




                                                                                   147 | P a g e
Remediation:

Add or edit server or pool lines to /etc/chrony.conf as appropriate:

2.2.2 Ensure X11 Server components are not installed (Automated)
Profile Applicability:

• Level 1 - Server

Description:

The X Window System provides a Graphical User Interface (GUI) where users can have
multiple windows in which to run programs and various add on. The X Windows system is
typically used on workstations where users login, but not on servers where users typically
do not login.

Rationale:

Unless your organization specifically requires graphical login access via X Windows,
remove it to reduce the potential attack surface.

Impact:

Many Linux systems run applications which require a Java runtime. Some Linux Java
packages have a dependency on specific X Windows xorg-x11-fonts. One workaround to
avoid this dependency is to use the "headless" Java packages for your specific Java runtime.

Audit:

Run the following command to Verify X Windows Server is not installed.

# rpm -qa xorg-x11-server*

Remediation:

Run the following command to remove the X Windows Server packages:

# zypper remove xorg-x11-server*

Description:

Avahi is a free zeroconf implementation, including a system for multicast DNS/DNS-SD
service discovery. Avahi allows programs to publish and discover services and hosts
running on a local network with no specific configuration. For example, a user can plug a
computer into a network and Avahi automatically finds printers to print to, files to look at
and people to talk to, as well as network services running on the machine.

Rationale:

Automatic discovery of network services is not normally required for system functionality.
It is recommended to remove this package to reduce the potential attack surface.

Audit:

Run one of the following command to verify avahi-autoipd and avahi are not installed:

# rpm -q avahi-autoipd avahi

package avahi-autoipd is not installed
package avahi is not installed

Description:

The Common Unix Print System (CUPS) provides the ability to print to both local and
network printers. A system running CUPS can also accept print jobs from remote systems
and print them to local printers. It also provides a web based remote administration
capability.

Rationale:

If the system does not need to print jobs or accept print jobs from other systems, it is
recommended that CUPS be removed to reduce the potential attack surface.

Note: Removing CUPS will prevent printing from the system

Impact:

Disabling CUPS will prevent printing from the system, a common task for workstation
systems.

2.2.7 Ensure nfs-utils is not installed or the nfs-server service is masked
(Automated)
Profile Applicability:

• Level 1 - Server
• Level 1 - Workstation

Description:

The Network File System (NFS) is one of the first and most widely distributed file systems
in the UNIX environment. It provides the ability for systems to mount file systems of other
servers through the network.

Rationale:

If the system does not require network shares, it is recommended that the nfs-utils and
nfs-kernel-server packages be removed to reduce the attack surface of the system.

Note: many of the libvirt packages used by Enterprise Linux virtualization are dependent on
the nfs-utils package. If the nfs-utils or nfs-kernel-server packages are required as a
dependency, the nfs-server service should be disabled and masked to reduce the attack surface
of the system

Audit:

Run the following command to verify nfs-utils and nfs-kernel-server are not installed:

# rpm -q nfs-utils nfs-kernel-server

package nfs-utils is not installed
package nfs-kernel-server is not installed

2.2.8 Ensure rpcbind is not installed or the rpcbind services are masked
(Automated)
Profile Applicability:

• Level 1 - Server
• Level 1 - Workstation

Description:

The rpcbind utility maps RPC services to the ports on which they listen. RPC processes
notify rpcbind when they start, registering the ports they are listening on and the RPC
program numbers they expect to serve. The client system then contacts rpcbind on the
server with a particular RPC program number. The rpcbind service redirects the client to
the proper port number so it can communicate with the requested service

Portmapper is an RPC service, which always listens on tcp and udp 111, and is used to map
other RPC services (such as nfs, nlockmgr, quotad, mountd, etc.) to their corresponding
port number on the server. When a remote host makes an RPC call to that server, it first
consults with portmap to determine where the RPC server is listening.

Rationale:

A small request (~82 bytes via UDP) sent to the Portmapper generates a large response (7x
to 28x amplification), which makes it a suitable tool for DDoS attacks. If rpcbind is not
required, it is recommended that the rpcbind package be removed to reduce the attack
surface of the system.

Note: many of the libvirt packages used by Enterprise Linux virtualization, and the nfs-utils
package used for The Network File System (NFS) are dependent on the rpcbind package. If the
rpcbind is required as a dependency, the services rpcbind.service and rpcbind.socket should be
stopped and masked to reduce the attack surface of the system.

2.2.13 Ensure Samba is not installed (Automated)
Profile Applicability:

• Level 1 - Server
• Level 1 - Workstation

Description:

The Samba daemon allows system administrators to configure their Linux systems to share
file systems and directories with Windows desktops. Samba will advertise the file systems
and directories via the Server Message Block (SMB) protocol. Windows desktop users will
be able to mount these directories and file systems as letter drives on their systems.

Rationale:

If there is no need to mount directories and file systems to Windows systems, then this
package can be removed to reduce the potential attack surface.

Audit:

Run the following command to verify samba is not installed:

# rpm -q samba

package samba is not installed

Remediation:

Run the following command to remove samba:

# zypper remove samba

2.2.15 Ensure net-snmp is not installed (Automated)
Profile Applicability:

• Level 1 - Server
• Level 1 - Workstation

Description:

Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) is a widely used protocol for monitoring the
health and welfare of network equipment, computer equipment and devices like UPSs.

   •     Net-SNMP is a suite of applications used to implement SNMPv1 (RFC 1157),
         SNMPv2 (RFCs 1901-1908), and SNMPv3 (RFCs 3411-3418) using both IPv4 and
         IPv6.
   •     Support for SNMPv2 classic (a.k.a. "SNMPv2 historic" - RFCs 1441-1452) was
         dropped with the 4.0 release of the UCD-snmp package.
   •     The Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) server is used to listen for SNMP
         commands from an SNMP management system, execute the commands or collect the
         information and then send results back to the requesting system.

Rationale:

The SNMP server can communicate using SNMPv1, which transmits data in the clear and
does not require authentication to execute commands. SNMPv3 replaces the simple/clear
text password sharing used in SNMPv2 with more securely encoded parameters. If the the
SNMP service is not required, the net-snmp package should be removed to reduce the
attack surface of the system.

Note: If SNMP is required:

   •     The server should be configured for SNMP v3 only. User Authentication and Message
         Encryption should be configured.
   •     If SNMP v2 is absolutely necessary, modify the community strings' values.

Audit:

Run the following command to verify net-snmp is not installed:

# rpm -q net-snmp

package net-snmp is not installed

2.2.16 Ensure mail transfer agent is configured for local-only mode
(Automated)
Profile Applicability:

• Level 1 - Server
• Level 1 - Workstation

Description:

Mail Transfer Agents (MTA), such as sendmail and Postfix, are used to listen for incoming
mail and transfer the messages to the appropriate user or mail server. If the system is not
intended to be a mail server, it is recommended that the MTA be configured to only process
local mail.

Rationale:

The software for all Mail Transfer Agents is complex and most have a long history of
security issues. While it is important to ensure that the system can process local mail
messages, it is not necessary to have the MTA's daemon listening on a port unless the
server is intended to be a mail server that receives and processes mail from other systems.

Notes:

    •    This recommendation is designed around the postfix mail server.
    •    Depending on your environment you may have an alternative MTA installed such as
         sendmail. If this is the case consult the documentation for your installed MTA to
         configure the recommended state.

Audit:

Run the following command to verify that the MTA is not listening on any non-loopback
address ( 127.0.0.1 or ::1 )

#   ss -lntu | grep -E ':25\s' | grep -E -v '\s(127.0.0.1|\[?::1\]?):25\s'

Nothing should be returned

Remediation:

Edit /etc/postfix/main.cf and add the following line to the RECEIVING MAIL section. If
the line already exists, change it to look like the line below:

inet_interfaces = loopback-only

Run the following command to restart postfix:

# systemctl restart postfix

2.2.17 Ensure rsync is not installed or the rsyncd service is masked
(Automated)
Profile Applicability:

• Level 1 - Server
• Level 1 - Workstation

Description:

The rsyncd service can be used to synchronize files between systems over network links.

Rationale:

Unless required, the rsync package should be removed to reduce the attack surface area of
the system.

The rsyncd service presents a security risk as it uses unencrypted protocols for
communication.

Note: If a required dependency exists for the rsync package, but the rsyncd service is not
required, the service should be masked.

Impact:

There are packages that are dependent on the rsync package. If the rsync package is
removed, these packages will be removed as well.

Before removing the rsync package, review any dependent packages to determine if they
are required on the system. If a dependent package is required, mask the rsyncd service
and leave the rsync package installed.

Audit:

Run the following command to verify that rsync is not installed:

# rpm -q rsync

package rsync is not installed

Description:

The ypserv package provides the Network Information Service (NIS). This service, formally
known as Yellow Pages, is a client-server directory service protocol for distributing system
configuration files. The NIS server is a collection of programs that allow for the distribution
of configuration files.

Rationale:

The NIS service is inherently an insecure system that has been vulnerable to DOS attacks,
buffer overflows and has poor authentication for querying NIS maps. NIS generally has
been replaced by such protocols as Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP). It is
recommended that the ypserv package be removed, and if required a more secure services
be used.

2.3.1 Ensure NIS Client is not installed (Automated)
Profile Applicability:

• Level 1 - Server
• Level 1 - Workstation

Description:

The Network Information Service (NIS), formerly known as Yellow Pages, is a client-server
directory service protocol used to distribute system configuration files. The NIS client (
ypbind ) was used to bind a machine to an NIS server and receive the distributed
configuration files.

Rationale:

The NIS service is inherently an insecure system that has been vulnerable to DOS attacks,
buffer overflows and has poor authentication for querying NIS maps. NIS generally has
been replaced by such protocols as Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP). It is
recommended that the service be removed.

Impact:

Many insecure service clients are used as troubleshooting tools and in testing
environments. Uninstalling them can inhibit capability to test and troubleshoot. If they are
required it is advisable to remove the clients after use to prevent accidental or intentional
misuse.

Audit:

Run the following command to verify that the ypbind package is not installed:

# rpm -q ypbind

package ypbind is not installed

Remediation:

Run the following command to remove the ypbind package:

# zypper remove ypbind

2.3.2 Ensure rsh client is not installed (Automated)
Profile Applicability:

• Level 1 - Server
• Level 1 - Workstation

Description:

The rsh package contains the client commands for the rsh services.

Rationale:

These legacy clients contain numerous security exposures and have been replaced with the
more secure SSH package. Even if the server is removed, it is best to ensure the clients are
also removed to prevent users from inadvertently attempting to use these commands and
therefore exposing their credentials. Note that removing the rsh package removes the
clients for rsh , rcp and rlogin.

Impact:

Many insecure service clients are used as troubleshooting tools and in testing
environments. Uninstalling them can inhibit capability to test and troubleshoot. If they are
required it is advisable to remove the clients after use to prevent accidental or intentional
misuse.

Audit:

Run the following command to verify that the rsh package is not installed:

# rpm -q rsh

package rsh is not installed

Remediation:

2.3.3 Ensure talk client is not installed (Automated)
Profile Applicability:

• Level 1 - Server
• Level 1 - Workstation

Description:

The talk software makes it possible for users to send and receive messages across systems
through a terminal session. The talk client, which allows initialization of talk sessions, is
installed by default.

Rationale:

The software presents a security risk as it uses unencrypted protocols for communication.

Impact:

Many insecure service clients are used as troubleshooting tools and in testing
environments. Uninstalling them can inhibit capability to test and troubleshoot. If they are
required it is advisable to remove the clients after use to prevent accidental or intentional

2.3.4 Ensure telnet client is not installed (Automated)
Profile Applicability:

• Level 1 - Server
• Level 1 - Workstation

Description:

The telnet package contains the telnet client, which allows users to start connections to
other systems via the telnet protocol.

Rationale:

The telnet protocol is insecure and unencrypted. The use of an unencrypted transmission
medium could allow an unauthorized user to steal credentials. The ssh package provides
an encrypted session and stronger security and is included in most Linux distributions.

Impact:

Many insecure service clients are used as troubleshooting tools and in testing
environments. Uninstalling them can inhibit capability to test and troubleshoot. If they are
required it is advisable to remove the clients after use to prevent accidental or intentional
misuse.

Audit:

Run the following command to verify that the telnet package is not installed:

2.3.5 Ensure LDAP client is not installed (Automated)
Profile Applicability:

• Level 1 - Server
• Level 1 - Workstation

Description:

The Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) was introduced as a replacement for
NIS/YP. It is a service that provides a method for looking up information from a central
database.

Rationale:

If the system will not need to act as an LDAP client, it is recommended that the software be
removed to reduce the potential attack surface.

Impact:

Removing the LDAP client will prevent or inhibit using LDAP for authentication in your
environment.

Audit:

Run the following command to verify that the openldap-clients package is not installed:

# rpm -q openldap2-clients

2.4 Ensure nonessential services are removed or masked (Manual)
Profile Applicability:

• Level 1 - Server
• Level 1 - Workstation

Description:

A network port is identified by its number, the associated IP address, and the type of the
communication protocol such as TCP or UDP.
A listening port is a network port on which an application or process listens on, acting as a
communication endpoint.
Each listening port can be open or closed (filtered) using a firewall. In general terms, an
open port is a network port that accepts incoming packets from remote locations.

Rationale:

Services listening on the system pose a potential risk as an attack vector. These services
should be reviewed, and if not required, the service should be stopped, and the package
containing the service should be removed. If required packages have a dependency, the
service should be stopped and masked to reduce the attack surface of the system.

Audit:

Run the following command:

# lsof -i -P -n | grep -v "(ESTABLISHED)"

Review the output to ensure that all services listed are required on the system. If a listed
service is not required, remove the package containing the service. If the package
containing the service is required, stop and mask the service

Remediation:

Run the following command to remove the package containing the service:

# zypper remove <package_name>

OR

If required packages have a dependency:

Run the following command to stop and mask the service:

# systemctl --now mask <service_name>

3.1.1 Disable IPv6 (Automated)
Profile Applicability:

• Level 2 - Server
• Level 2 - Workstation

Description:

Although IPv6 has many advantages over IPv4, not all organizations have IPv6 or dual
stack configurations implemented.

Rationale:

If IPv6 or dual stack is not to be used, it is recommended that IPv6 be disabled to reduce
the attack surface of the system.

Impact:

If IPv6 is disabled through sysctl config, SSH X11forwarding may no longer function as
expected.

We recommend that SSH X11forwarding be disabled, but if required, the following will
allow for SSH X11forwarding with IPv6 disabled through sysctl config:
Add the following line the /etc/ssh/sshd_config file:

AddressFamily inet

Run the following command to re-start the openSSH server:

# systemctl restart sshd




                                                                                191 | P a g e
Audit:

Run the following commands to verify that one of the following methods has been used to
disable IPv6:

If IPv6 is disabled through the GRUB2 config:

Run the following command and verify no lines should be returned.

#    grep "^\s*linux" /boot/grub2/grub.cfg | grep -v ipv6.disable=1

OR

If IPv6 is disabled through sysctl settings:

Run the following commands:

# sysctl net.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6

net.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6 = 1

# sysctl net.ipv6.conf.default.disable_ipv6

net.ipv6.conf.default.disable_ipv6 = 1

# grep -E
'^\s*net\.ipv6\.conf\.(all|default)\.disable_ipv6\s*=\s*1\b(\s+#.*)?$'
/etc/sysctl.conf /etc/sysctl.d/*.conf | cut -d: -f2

net.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6 = 1
net.ipv6.conf.default.disable_ipv6 = 1

Remediation:

Use one of the two following methods to disable IPv6 on the system:

To disable IPv6 through the GRUB2 config:

Edit /etc/default/grub and add ipv6.disable=1 to the GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX parameters:

GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="ipv6.disable=1"

Run the following command to update the grub2 configuration:

# grub2-mkconfig –o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg

OR

To disable IPv6 through sysctl settings:

Set the following parameters in /etc/sysctl.conf or a /etc/sysctl.d/* file:

net.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6 = 1
net.ipv6.conf.default.disable_ipv6 = 1

Run the following commands to set the active kernel parameters:

# sysctl -w net.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6=1
# sysctl -w net.ipv6.conf.default.disable_ipv6=1
# sysctl -w net.ipv6.route.flush=1

3.2.1 Ensure IP forwarding is disabled (Automated)
Profile Applicability:

• Level 1 - Server
• Level 1 - Workstation

Description:

The net.ipv4.ip_forward and net.ipv6.conf.all.forwarding flags are used to tell the
system whether it can forward packets or not.

Rationale:

Setting the flags to 0 ensures that a system with multiple interfaces (for example, a hard
proxy), will never be able to forward packets, and therefore, never serve as a router.




                                                                                197 | P a g e

3.2.2 Ensure packet redirect sending is disabled (Automated)
Profile Applicability:

• Level 1 - Server
• Level 1 - Workstation

Description:

ICMP Redirects are used to send routing information to other hosts. As a host itself does
not act as a router (in a host only configuration), there is no need to send redirects.

Rationale:

An attacker could use a compromised host to send invalid ICMP redirects to other router
devices in an attempt to corrupt routing and have users access a system set up by the
attacker as opposed to a valid system.

3.3.1 Ensure source routed packets are not accepted (Automated)
Profile Applicability:

• Level 1 - Server
• Level 1 - Workstation

Description:

In networking, source routing allows a sender to partially or fully specify the route packets
take through a network. In contrast, non-source routed packets travel a path determined
by routers in the network. In some cases, systems may not be routable or reachable from
some locations (e.g. private addresses vs. Internet routable), and so source routed packets
would need to be used.

Rationale:

Setting net.ipv4.conf.all.accept_source_route,
net.ipv4.conf.default.accept_source_route,
net.ipv6.conf.all.accept_source_route and
net.ipv6.conf.default.accept_source_route to 0 disables the system from accepting
source routed packets. Assume this system was capable of routing packets to Internet
routable addresses on one interface and private addresses on another interface. Assume
that the private addresses were not routable to the Internet routable addresses and vice
versa. Under normal routing circumstances, an attacker from the Internet routable
addresses could not use the system as a way to reach the private address systems. If,
however, source routed packets were allowed, they could be used to gain access to the
private address systems as the route could be specified, rather than rely on routing
protocols that did not allow this routing.

3.3.2 Ensure ICMP redirects are not accepted (Automated)
Profile Applicability:

• Level 1 - Server
• Level 1 - Workstation

Description:

ICMP redirect messages are packets that convey routing information and tell your host
(acting as a router) to send packets via an alternate path. It is a way of allowing an outside
routing device to update your system routing tables. By setting
net.ipv4.conf.all.accept_redirects and net.ipv6.conf.all.accept_redirects to 0,
the system will not accept any ICMP redirect messages, and therefore, won't allow
outsiders to update the system's routing tables.

Rationale:

Attackers could use bogus ICMP redirect messages to maliciously alter the system routing
tables and get them to send packets to incorrect networks and allow your system packets
to be captured.

3.3.3 Ensure secure ICMP redirects are not accepted (Automated)
Profile Applicability:

• Level 1 - Server
• Level 1 - Workstation

Description:

Secure ICMP redirects are the same as ICMP redirects, except they come from gateways
listed on the default gateway list. It is assumed that these gateways are known to your
system, and that they are likely to be secure.

Rationale:

It is still possible for even known gateways to be compromised. Setting
net.ipv4.conf.all.secure_redirects to 0 protects the system from routing table
updates by possibly compromised known gateways.

Run the following commands and verify output matches:

# sysctl net.ipv4.conf.all.secure_redirects

net.ipv4.conf.all.secure_redirects = 0

# sysctl net.ipv4.conf.default.secure_redirects

3.3.5 Ensure broadcast ICMP requests are ignored (Automated)
Profile Applicability:

• Level 1 - Server
• Level 1 - Workstation

Description:

Setting net.ipv4.icmp_echo_ignore_broadcasts to 1 will cause the system to ignore all
ICMP echo and timestamp requests to broadcast and multicast addresses.

Rationale:

Accepting ICMP echo and timestamp requests with broadcast or multicast destinations for
your network could be used to trick your host into starting (or participating) in a Smurf
attack. A Smurf attack relies on an attacker sending large amounts of ICMP broadcast
messages with a spoofed source address. All hosts receiving this message and responding
would send echo-reply messages back to the spoofed address, which is probably not
routable. If many hosts respond to the packets, the amount of traffic on the network could
be significantly multiplied.

Audit:

Run the following commands and verify output matches:

# sysctl net.ipv4.icmp_echo_ignore_broadcasts

net.ipv4.icmp_echo_ignore_broadcasts = 1

# grep "net\.ipv4\.icmp_echo_ignore_broadcasts" /etc/sysctl.conf

3.3.7 Ensure Reverse Path Filtering is enabled (Automated)
Profile Applicability:

• Level 1 - Server
• Level 1 - Workstation

Description:

Setting net.ipv4.conf.all.rp_filter and net.ipv4.conf.default.rp_filter to 1 forces
the Linux kernel to utilize reverse path filtering on a received packet to determine if the
packet was valid. Essentially, with reverse path filtering, if the return packet does not go
out the same interface that the corresponding source packet came from, the packet is
dropped (and logged if log_martians is set).

Rationale:

Setting these flags is a good way to deter attackers from sending your system bogus
packets that cannot be responded to. One instance where this feature breaks down is if
asymmetrical routing is employed. This would occur when using dynamic routing protocols
(bgp, ospf, etc) on your system. If you are using asymmetrical routing on your system, you
will not be able to enable this feature without breaking the routing.

Audit:

# sysctl net.ipv4.conf.all.rp_filter

3.3.8 Ensure TCP SYN Cookies is enabled (Automated)
Profile Applicability:

• Level 1 - Server
• Level 1 - Workstation

Description:

When tcp_syncookies is set, the kernel will handle TCP SYN packets normally until the
half-open connection queue is full, at which time, the SYN cookie functionality kicks in. SYN
cookies work by not using the SYN queue at all. Instead, the kernel simply replies to the
SYN with a SYN|ACK, but will include a specially crafted TCP sequence number that
encodes the source and destination IP address and port number and the time the packet
was sent. A legitimate connection would send the ACK packet of the three way handshake
with the specially crafted sequence number. This allows the system to verify that it has
received a valid response to a SYN cookie and allow the connection, even though there is no
corresponding SYN in the queue.

Rationale:

Attackers use SYN flood attacks to perform a denial of service attacked on a system by
sending many SYN packets without completing the three-way handshake. This will quickly
use up slots in the kernel's half-open connection queue and prevent legitimate connections
from succeeding. SYN cookies allow the system to keep accepting valid connections, even if
under a denial of service attack.

Audit:

Run the following commands and verify output matches:

# sysctl net.ipv4.tcp_syncookies

It is recommended that systems do not accept router advertisements as they could be
tricked into routing traffic to compromised machines. Setting hard routes within the
system (usually a single default route to a trusted router) protects the system from bad
routes.

The Datagram Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP) is a transport layer protocol that
supports streaming media and telephony. DCCP provides a way to gain access to
congestion control, without having to do it at the application layer, but does not provide in-
sequence delivery.

Rationale:

If the protocol is not required, it is recommended that the drivers not be installed to reduce
the potential attack surface.

Description:

The Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) is a transport layer protocol used to
support message oriented communication, with several streams of messages in one
connection. It serves a similar function as TCP and UDP, incorporating features of both. It is
message-oriented like UDP, and ensures reliable in-sequence transport of messages with
congestion control like TCP.

3.5 Firewall Configuration
A firewall is a set of rules. When a data packet moves into or out of a protected network
space, its contents (in particular, information about its origin, target, and the protocol it
plans to use) are tested against the firewall rules to see if it should be allowed through
To provide a Host Based Firewall, the Linux kernel includes support for:

   •     Netfilter - A set of hooks inside the Linux kernel that allows kernel modules to
         register callback functions with the network stack. A registered callback function is
         then called back for every packet that traverses the respective hook within the
         network stack. Includes the ip_tables, ip6_tables, arp_tables, and ebtables kernel
         modules. These modules are some of the significant parts of the Netfilter hook
         system.
   •     nftables - A subsystem of the Linux kernel providing filtering and classification of
         network packets/datagrams/frames. nftables is supposed to replace certain parts of
         Netfilter, while keeping and reusing most of it. nftables utilizes the building blocks
         of the Netfilter infrastructure, such as the existing hooks into the networking stack,
         connection tracking system, userspace queuing component, and logging subsystem.
         Is available in Linux kernels 3.13 and newer.

In order to configure firewall rules for Netfilter or nftables, a firewall utility needs to be
installed. Guidance has been included for the following firewall utilities:

   •     FirewallD - Provides firewall features by acting as a front-end for the Linux kernel's
         netfilter framework via the iptables backend. Starting in v0.6.0, FirewallD added
         support for acting as a front-end for the Linux kernel's netfilter framework via the
         nftables userspace utility, acting as an alternative to the nft command line program.
         firewalld supports both IPv4 and IPv6 networks and can administer separate
         firewall zones with varying degrees of trust as defined in zone profiles.
   •     nftables - Includes the nft utility for configuration of the nftables subsystem of the
         Linux kernel
   •     iptables - Includes the iptables, ip6tables, arptables and ebtables utilities for
         configuration Netfilter and the ip_tables, ip6_tables, arp_tables, and ebtables kernel
         modules.

Notes:

   •     Only one method should be used to configure a firewall on the system. Use of more
         than one method could produce unexpected results.
   •     This section is intended only to ensure the resulting firewall rules are in place, not how
         they are configured.

3.5.1 Configure firewalld
If nftables or iptables are being used in your environment, please follow the guidance in their
respective section and pass-over the guidance in this section.

firewalld (Dynamic Firewall Manager) provides a dynamically managed firewall with
support for network/firewall “zones” to assign a level of trust to a network and its
associated connections, interfaces or sources. It has support for IPv4, IPv6, Ethernet
bridges and also for IPSet firewall settings. There is a separation of the runtime and
permanent configuration options. It also provides an interface for services or applications
to add iptables, ip6tables and ebtables rules directly. This interface can also be used by
advanced users.

In the v0.6.0 release, firewalld gained support for using nftables as a firewall backend.

Note: Configuration of a live system's firewall directly over a remote connection will often
result in being locked out.

3.5.1.1 Ensure FirewallD is installed (Automated)
Profile Applicability:

• Level 1 - Server
• Level 1 - Workstation

Description:

firewalld is a firewall management tool for Linux operating systems. It provides firewall
features by acting as a front-end for the Linux kernel's netfilter framework via the iptables
backend or provides firewall features by acting as a front-end for the Linux kernel's
netfilter framework via the nftables utility.

firewallD replaces iptables as the default firewall management tool. Use the firewalld utility
to configure a firewall for less complex firewalls. The utility is easy to use and covers the
typical use cases scenario. FirewallD supports both IPv4 and IPv6 networks and can
administer separate firewall zones with varying degrees of trust as defined in zone profiles.

Note: Starting in v0.6.0, FirewallD added support for acting as a front-end for the Linux
kernel's netfilter framework via the nftables userspace utility, acting as an alternative to the
nft command line program.

Rationale:

A firewall utility is required to configure the Linux kernel's netfilter framework via the
iptables or nftables back-end.

The Linux kernel's netfilter framework host-based firewall can protect against threats
originating from within a corporate network to include malicious mobile code and poorly
configured software on a host.

Note: Only one firewall utility should be installed and configured. FirewallD is dependent on
the iptables package.

Impact:

Changing firewall settings while connected over the network can result in being locked out
of the system.

3.5.1.4 Ensure default zone is set (Automated)
Profile Applicability:

• Level 1 - Server
• Level 1 - Workstation

Description:

A firewall zone defines the trust level for a connection, interface or source address binding.
This is a one to many relationship, which means that a connection, interface or source can
only be part of one zone, but a zone can be used for many network connections, interfaces
and sources.

   •   The default zone is the zone that is used for everything that is not explicitly
       bound/assigned to another zone.
   •   If no zone assigned to a connection, interface or source, only the default zone is
       used.
   •   The default zone is not always listed as being used for an interface or source as it
       will be used for it either way. This depends on the manager of the interfaces.

Connections handled by NetworkManager are listed as NetworkManager requests to add
the zone binding for the interface used by the connection. Also interfaces under control of
the network service are listed also because the service requests it.
Notes:

   •   A firewalld zone configuration file contains the information for a zone.
           o These are the zone description, services, ports, protocols, icmp-blocks,
              masquerade, forward-ports and rich language rules in an XML file format.
           o The file name has to be zone_name.xml where length of zone_name is currently
              limited to 17 chars.
   •   NetworkManager binds interfaces to zones automatically

Rationale:

Because the default zone is the zone that is used for everything that is not explicitly
bound/assigned to another zone, it is important for the default zone to set




                                                                                  239 | P a g e
Audit:

Run the following command and verify that the default zone adheres to company policy:

# firewall-cmd --get-default-zone

Remediation:

Run the following command to set the default zone:

# firewall-cmd --set-default-zone=<NAME_OF_ZONE>

Example:

# firewall-cmd --set-default-zone=public

3.5.1.5 Ensure network interfaces are assigned to appropriate zone
(Manual)
Profile Applicability:

• Level 1 - Server
• Level 1 - Workstation

Description:

firewall zones define the trust level of network connections or interfaces.

Note: The firewall in the Linux kernel is not able to handle network connections with the
name shown by NetworkManager, it can only handle the network interfaces used by the
connection. Because of this NetworkManager tells firewalld to assign the network interface
that is used for this connection to the zone defined in the configuration of that connection.
This assignment happens before the interface is used. The configuration of the connection can
either be the NetworkManager configuration or also an ifcfg. For example: If the zone is not
set in the configuration file, the interfaces will be assigned to the default zone defined in the
firewalld configuration. If a connection has more than one interface, all of them will be
supplied to firewalld. Also changes in the names of interfaces will be handled by
NetworkManager and supplied to firewalld.

Rationale:

A network interface not assigned to the appropriate zone can allow unexpected or
undesired network traffic to be accepted on the interface.

Impact:

Changing firewall settings while connected over network can result in being locked out of
the system.

Audit:

Run the following command, and verify that the interface(s) follow site policy for zone
assignment

# nmcli -t connection show | awk -F: '{if($4){print $4}}' | while read INT;
do firewall-cmd --get-active-zones | grep -B1 $INT; done




                                                                                    241 | P a g e
Remediation:

Run the following command to assign an interface to the approprate zone.

# firewall-cmd --zone=<Zone NAME> --change-interface=<INTERFACE NAME>

Example:

# firewall-cmd --zone=customezone --change-interface=eth0

Default Value:

If the zone is not set in the configuration file, the interfaces will be assigned to the default
zone defined in the firewalld configuration

3.5.1.6 Ensure unnecessary services and ports are not accepted
(Manual)
Profile Applicability:

• Level 1 - Server
• Level 1 - Workstation

Description:

Services and ports can be accepted or explicitly rejected or dropped by a zone.
For every zone, you can set a default behavior that handles incoming traffic that is not
further specified. Such behavior is defined by setting the target of the zone. There are three
options - default, ACCEPT, REJECT, and DROP.

   •     ACCEPT - you accept all incoming packets except those disabled by a specific rule.
   •     REJECT - you disable all incoming packets except those that you have allowed in
         specific rules and the source machine is informed about the rejection.
   •     DROP - you disable all incoming packets except those that you have allowed in
         specific rules and no information sent to the source machine.

Rationale:

To reduce the attack surface of a system, all services and ports should be blocked unless
required

Audit:

Run the following command and review output to ensure that listed services and ports
follow site policy.

# firewall-cmd --get-active-zones | awk '!/:/ {print $1}' | while read ZN; do
firewall-cmd --list-all --zone=$ZN; done

3.5.2 Configure nftables
If firewalld or iptables are being used in your environment, please follow the guidance in their
respective section and pass-over the guidance in this section.

nftables is a subsystem of the Linux kernel providing filtering and classification of network
packets/datagrams/frames and is the successor to iptables. The biggest change with the
successor nftables is its simplicity. With iptables, we have to configure every single rule and
use the syntax which can be compared with normal commands. With nftables, the simpler
syntax, much like BPF (Berkely Packet Filter) means shorter lines and less repetition.
Support for nftables should also be compiled into the kernel, together with the related
nftables modules. It is available in Linux kernels >= 3.13. Please ensure that your kernel
supports nftables before choosing this option.

This section broadly assumes starting with an empty nftables firewall ruleset (established
by flushing the rules with nft flush ruleset). Remediation steps included only affect the live
system, you will also need to configure your default firewall configuration to apply on boot.
Configuration of a live systems firewall directly over a remote connection will often
result in being locked out. It is advised to have a known good firewall configuration set to
run on boot and to configure an entire firewall structure in a script that is then run and
tested before saving to boot.

Note: Configuration of a live systems firewall directly over a remote connection will often
result in being locked out. It is advised to have a known good firewall configuration set to run

The following will implement the firewall rules of this section and open ICMP, IGMP, and port
22(ssh) from anywhere. Opening the ports for ICMP, IGMP, and port 22(ssh) needs to be
updated in accordance with local site policy. Allow port 22(ssh) needs to be updated to only
allow systems requiring ssh connectivity to connect, as per site policy.

3.5.2.1 Ensure nftables is installed (Automated)
Profile Applicability:

• Level 1 - Server
• Level 1 - Workstation

Description:

nftables provides a new in-kernel packet classification framework that is based on a
network-specific Virtual Machine (VM) and a new nft userspace command line tool.
nftables reuses the existing Netfilter subsystems such as the existing hook infrastructure,
the connection tracking system, NAT, userspace queuing and logging subsystem.
Notes:

   •     nftables is available in Linux kernel 3.13 and newer.
   •     Only one firewall utility should be installed and configured.

Rationale:

nftables is a subsystem of the Linux kernel that can protect against threats originating from
within a corporate network to include malicious mobile code and poorly configured
software on a host.

Impact:

Changing firewall settings while connected over the network can result in being locked out
of the system.

Audit:

Run the following command to verify that nftables is installed:

# rpm -q nftables

nftables-<version>

Remediation:

Run the following command to install nftables

# zypper install nftables

3.5.2.2 Ensure firewalld is not installed or stopped and masked
(Automated)
Profile Applicability:

• Level 1 - Server
• Level 1 - Workstation

Description:

firewalld (Dynamic Firewall Manager) provides a dynamically managed firewall with
support for network/firewall “zones” to assign a level of trust to a network and its
associated connections, interfaces or sources. It has support for IPv4, IPv6, Ethernet
bridges and also for IPSet firewall settings. There is a separation of the runtime and
permanent configuration options.

Rationale:

Running both nftables.service and firewalld.service may lead to conflict and
unexpected results.

Audit:

Run the following command to verify that firewalld is not installed:

# rpm -q firewalld

package firewalld is not installed

OR

Run the following commands to verify that firewalld is stopped and masked

# systemctl status firewalld | grep "Active: " | grep -v            "active (running) "

No output should be returned

# systemctl is-enabled firewalld

masked




                                                                               251 | P a g e
Remediation:

Run the following command to remove firewalld

# zypper remove firewalld

OR

Run the following command to stop and mask firewalld

# systemctl --now mask firewalld

Description:

nftables is a replacement for iptables, ip6tables, ebtables and arptables

Rationale:

It is possible to mix iptables and nftables. However, this increases complexity and also the
chance to introduce errors. For simplicity flush out all iptables rules, and ensure it is not
loaded

Audit:

Run the following commands to ensure not iptables rules exist
For iptables:

# iptables -L

No rules should be returned
For ip6tables:

# ip6tables -L

No rules should be returned

Remediation:

Run the following commands to flush iptables:
For iptables:

# iptables -F

For ip6tables

# ip6tables -F

3.5.2.4 Ensure a table exists (Automated)
Profile Applicability:

• Level 1 - Server
• Level 1 - Workstation

Description:

Tables hold chains. Each table only has one address family and only applies to packets of
this family. Tables can have one of five families.

Rationale:

nftables doesn't have any default tables. Without a table being build, nftables will not filter
network traffic.

Impact:

Adding rules to a running nftables can cause loss of connectivity to the system

Audit:

Run the following command to verify that a nftables table exists:

# nft list tables

Return should include a list of nftables:
Example:

table inet filter

Remediation:

Run the following command to create a table in nftables

# nft create table inet <table name>

Example:

# nft create table inet filter

3.5.2.5 Ensure base chains exist (Automated)
Profile Applicability:

• Level 1 - Server
• Level 1 - Workstation

Description:

Chains are containers for rules. They exist in two kinds, base chains and regular chains. A
base chain is an entry point for packets from the networking stack, a regular chain may be
used as jump target and is used for better rule organization.

Rationale:

If a base chain doesn't exist with a hook for input, forward, and delete, packets that would
flow through those chains will not be touched by nftables.

Impact:

if configuring nftables over ssh, creating a base chain with a policy of drop will cause loss
of connectivity.
Ensure that a rule allowing ssh has been added to the base chain prior to setting the base
chain's policy to drop

Audit:

Run the following commands and verify that base chains exist for INPUT, FORWARD, and
OUTPUT.

# nft list ruleset | grep 'hook input'

type filter hook input priority 0;

# nft list ruleset | grep 'hook forward'

type filter hook forward priority 0;

# nft list ruleset | grep 'hook output'

type filter hook output priority 0;

# nft create chain inet filter input { type filter hook input priority 0 \; }

Description:

Configure the loopback interface to accept traffic. Configure all other interfaces to deny
traffic to the loopback network

Rationale:

Loopback traffic is generated between processes on machine and is typically critical to
operation of the system. The loopback interface is the only place that loopback network
traffic should be seen, all other interfaces should ignore traffic on this network as an anti-
spoofing measure.

3.5.2.8 Ensure default deny firewall policy (Automated)
Profile Applicability:

• Level 1 - Server
• Level 1 - Workstation

Description:

Base chain policy is the default verdict that will be applied to packets reaching the end of
the chain.

Rationale:

There are two policies: accept (Default) and drop. If the policy is set to accept, the firewall
will accept any packet that is not configured to be denied and the packet will continue
traversing the network stack.

It is easier to allow acceptable usage than to block unacceptable usage.

Note: Changing firewall settings while connected over network can result in being locked out
of the system.

Impact:

if configuring nftables over ssh, creating a base chain with a policy of drop will cause loss of
connectivity.
Ensure that a rule allowing ssh has been added to the base chain prior to setting the base
chain's policy to drop

Audit:

Run the following commands and verify that base chains contain a policy of DROP.

# nft list ruleset | grep 'hook input'

type filter hook input priority 0; policy drop;

# nft list ruleset | grep 'hook forward'

type filter hook forward priority 0; policy drop;

# nft list ruleset | grep 'hook output'

type filter hook output priority 0; policy drop;




                                                                                  264 | P a g e
Remediation:

Run the following command for the base chains with the input, forward, and output hooks
to implement a default DROP policy:

# nft chain <table family> <table name> <chain name> { policy drop \; }

Example:

# nft chain inet filter input { policy drop \; }

# nft chain inet filter forward { policy drop \; }

# nft chain inet filter output { policy drop \; }

Default Value:

accept

3.5.2.10 Ensure nftables rules are permanent (Automated)
Profile Applicability:

• Level 1 - Server
• Level 1 - Workstation

Description:

nftables is a subsystem of the Linux kernel providing filtering and classification of network
packets/datagrams/frames.
The nftables service reads the /etc/sysconfig/nftables.conf file for a nftables file or
files to include in the nftables ruleset.
A nftables ruleset containing the input, forward, and output base chains allow network
traffic to be filtered.

Rationale:

Changes made to nftables ruleset only affect the live system, you will also need to configure
the nftables ruleset to apply on boot




                                                                                267 | P a g e
Audit:

Run the following commands to verify that input, forward, and output base chains are
configured to be applied to a nftables ruleset on boot:

Run the following command to verify the input base chain:

# awk '/hook input/,/}/' $(awk '$1 ~ /^\s*include/ { gsub("\"","",$2);print
$2 }' /etc/sysconfig/nftables.conf)

Output should be similar to:

                    type filter hook input priority 0; policy drop;

                    # Ensure loopback traffic is configured

Note: Review the input base chain to ensure that it follows local site policy

Run the following command to verify the forward base chain:

# awk '/hook forward/,/}/' $(awk '$1 ~ /^\s*include/ { gsub("\"","",$2);print
$2 }' /etc/sysconfig/nftables.conf)

Output should be similar to:

        # Base chain for hook forward named forward (Filters forwarded
network packets)
        chain forward {
                 type filter hook forward priority 0; policy drop;
        }

Note: Review the forward base chain to ensure that it follows local site policy.




                                                                                   268 | P a g e
Run the following command to verify the forward base chain:

# awk '/hook output/,/}/' $(awk '$1 ~ /^\s*include/ { gsub("\"","",$2);print
$2 }' /etc/sysconfig/nftables.conf)

Output should be similar to:

           # Base chain for hook output named output (Filters outbound network
packets)
           chain output {
                   type filter hook output priority 0; policy drop;

Note: Review the output base chain to ensure that it follows local site policy.

Remediation:

Edit the /etc/sysconfig/nftables.conf file and un-comment or add a line with include
<Absolute path to nftables rules file> for each nftables file you want included in the
nftables ruleset on boot
Example:

# vi /etc/sysconfig/nftables.conf

Add the line:

3.5.3 Configure iptables
If firewalld or nftables are being used in your environment, please follow the
guidance in their respective section and pass-over the guidance in this section.

IPtables is an application that allows a system administrator to configure the IPv4 and IPv6
tables, chains and rules provided by the Linux kernel firewall. While several methods of
configuration exist, this section is intended only to ensure the resulting IPtables rules are in
place, not how they are configured. If IPv6 is in use in your environment, similar settings
should be applied to the IP6tables as well.

Note: Configuration of a live systems firewall directly over a remote connection will often
result in being locked out. It is advised to have a known good firewall configuration set to run
on boot and to configure an entire firewall structure in a script that is then run and tested
before saving to boot.




                                                                                   270 | P a g e
3.5.3.1 Configure software
This section provides guidance for installing, enabling, removing, and disabling software
packages necessary for using IPTables as the method for configuring and maintaining a
Host Based Firewall on the system.

Note: Using more than one method to configure and maintain a Host Based Firewall can
cause unexpected results. If FirewallD or NFTables are being used for configuration and
maintenance, this guidance should be based over and the guidance in their respective section
followed.

3.5.3.2 Configure IPv4 iptables
Iptables is used to set up, maintain, and inspect the tables of IP packet filter rules in the
Linux kernel. Several different tables may be defined. Each table contains a number of
built-in chains and may also contain user-defined chains.

Each chain is a list of rules which can match a set of packets. Each rule specifies what to do
with a packet that matches. This is called a 'target', which may be a jump to a user-defined
chain in the same table.

Notes:

   •     This section broadly assumes starting with an empty IPtables firewall ruleset
         (established by flushing the rules with iptables -F).
   •     Configuration of a live systems firewall directly over a remote connection will often
         result in being locked out. It is advised to have a known good firewall configuration set
         to run on boot and to configure an entire firewall structure in a script that is then run
         and tested before saving to boot. The following script will implement the firewall rules
         of this section and open port 22(ssh) from anywhere. This needs to be updated to only
         allow systems requiring ssh connectivity to connect as per site policy.

3.5.3.2.1 Ensure default deny firewall policy (Automated)
Profile Applicability:

• Level 1 - Server
• Level 1 - Workstation

Description:

A default deny all policy on connections ensures that any unconfigured network usage will
be rejected.

Rationale:

With a default accept policy the firewall will accept any packet that is not configured to be
denied. It is easier to white list acceptable usage than to black list unacceptable usage.

Note: Changing firewall settings while connected over network can result in being locked out
of the system.

Audit:

Run the following command and verify that the policy for the INPUT, OUTPUT, and FORWARD
chains is DROP or REJECT:

# iptables -L
Chain INPUT (policy DROP)
Chain FORWARD (policy DROP)
Chain OUTPUT (policy DROP)

Remediation:

Run the following commands to implement a default DROP policy:

# iptables -P INPUT DROP
# iptables -P OUTPUT DROP
# iptables -P FORWARD DROP

3.5.3.2.2 Ensure loopback traffic is configured (Automated)
Profile Applicability:

• Level 1 - Server
• Level 1 - Workstation

Description:

Configure the loopback interface to accept traffic. Configure all other interfaces to deny
traffic to the loopback network (127.0.0.0/8).

Rationale:

Loopback traffic is generated between processes on machine and is typically critical to
operation of the system. The loopback interface is the only place that loopback network
(127.0.0.0/8) traffic should be seen, all other interfaces should ignore traffic on this
network as an anti-spoofing measure.

Note: Changing firewall settings while connected over network can result in being locked out
of the system.

Audit:

Run the following commands and verify output includes the listed rules in order (packet
and byte counts may differ):

# iptables -L INPUT -v -n
Chain INPUT (policy DROP 0 packets, 0 bytes)
 pkts bytes target     prot opt in     out               source

Description:

Configure the firewall rules for new outbound, and established connections.

Rationale:

If rules are not in place for new outbound, and established connections all packets will be
dropped by the default policy preventing network usage.

Note: Changing firewall settings while connected over network can result in being locked out
of the system.

3.5.3.3.1 Ensure IPv6 default deny firewall policy (Automated)
Profile Applicability:

• Level 1 - Server
• Level 1 - Workstation

Description:

A default deny all policy on connections ensures that any unconfigured network usage will
be rejected.

Rationale:

With a default accept policy the firewall will accept any packet that is not configured to be
denied. It is easier to white list acceptable usage than to black list unacceptable usage.

Note: Changing firewall settings while connected over network can result in being locked out
of the system.




                                                                                 288 | P a g e
Audit:

Run the following command and verify that the policy for the INPUT, OUTPUT, and
FORWARD chains is DROP or REJECT:

# ip6tables -L
Chain INPUT (policy DROP)
Chain FORWARD (policy DROP)
Chain OUTPUT (policy DROP)

OR

Verify IPv6 is disabled:

Run the following script. Output will confirm if IPv6 is disabled on the system.

3.5.3.3.2 Ensure IPv6 loopback traffic is configured (Automated)
Profile Applicability:

• Level 1 - Server
• Level 1 - Workstation

Description:

Configure the loopback interface to accept traffic. Configure all other interfaces to deny
traffic to the loopback network (::1).

Rationale:

Loopback traffic is generated between processes on machine and is typically critical to
operation of the system. The loopback interface is the only place that loopback network
(::1) traffic should be seen, all other interfaces should ignore traffic on this network as an
anti-spoofing measure.

Note: Changing firewall settings while connected over network can result in being locked out
of the system.

4 Logging and Auditing
The items in this section describe how to configure logging, log monitoring, and auditing,
using tools included in most distributions.

It is recommended that rsyslog be used for logging (with logwatch providing
summarization) and auditd be used for auditing (with aureport providing summarization)
to automatically monitor logs for intrusion attempts and other suspicious system behavior.
In addition to the local log files created by the steps in this section, it is also recommended
that sites collect copies of their system logs on a secure, centralized log server via an
encrypted connection. Not only does centralized logging help sites correlate events that
may be occurring on multiple systems, but having a second copy of the system log
information may be critical after a system compromise where the attacker has modified the
local log files on the affected system(s). If a log correlation system is deployed, configure it
to process the logs described in this section.

Because it is often necessary to correlate log information from many different systems
(particularly after a security incident) it is recommended that the time be synchronized
among systems and devices connected to the local network. The standard Internet protocol
for time synchronization is the Network Time Protocol (NTP), which is supported by most
network-ready devices. See the ntpd(8) manual page for more information on configuring
NTP.

It is important that all logs described in this section be monitored on a regular basis and
correlated to determine trends. A seemingly innocuous entry in one log could be more
significant when compared to an entry in another log.

Note on log file permissions: There really isn't a "one size fits all" solution to the permissions
on log files. Many sites utilize group permissions so that administrators who are in a defined
security group, such as "wheel" do not have to elevate privileges to root in order to read log
files. Also, if a third party log aggregation tool is used, it may need to have group permissions
to read the log files, which is preferable to having it run setuid to root. Therefore, there are
two remediation and audit steps for log file permissions. One is for systems that do not have a
secured group method implemented that only permits root to read the log files (root:root
600). The other is for sites that do have such a setup and are designated as root:securegrp
640 where securegrp is the defined security group (in some cases wheel).

4.1 Configure System Accounting (auditd)
System auditing, through auditd, allows system administrators to monitor their systems
such that they can detect unauthorized access or modification of data. By default, auditd
will audit system logins, account modifications, and authentication events. Events will be
logged to /var/log/audit/audit.log. The recording of these events will use a modest
amount of disk space on a system. If significantly more events are captured, additional on
system or off system storage may need to be allocated.

Notes:

   •     The recommendations in this section implement an audit policy that produces large
         quantities of logged data. In some environments it can be challenging to store or
         process these logs and as such they are marked as Level 2 for both Servers and
         Workstations.
   •     For 64 bit systems that have arch as a rule parameter, you will need two rules: one for
         64 bit and one for 32 bit systems. For 32 bit systems, only one rule is needed.
   •     Several recommendations in this section filter based off of auid>=1000 for
         unprivileged non-system users. Some systems may have a non-default UID_MIN setting,
         consult the UID_MIN setting in /etc/login.defs to determine the UID_MIN setting for
         your system.
   •     Once all audit rules have been added to a file or files in the /etc/audit/rules.d/
         directory, the auditd service must be re-started, or the system rebooted, for the
         new rules to be included.
   •     The audit and remediation in this section look for a 'key' value. The 'key' value may
         be different for the audit settings on your system.

Audit events need to be captured on processes that start up prior to auditd , so that
potential malicious activity cannot go undetected.

Note: This recommendation is designed around the grub2 bootloader, if LILO or another

4.1.2 Configure Data Retention
When auditing, it is important to carefully configure the storage requirements for audit
logs. By default, auditd will max out the log files at 5MB and retain only 4 copies of them.
Older versions will be deleted. It is possible on a system that the 20 MBs of audit logs may
fill up the system causing loss of audit data. While the recommendations here provide
guidance, check your site policy for audit storage requirements.




                                                                                308 | P a g e
4.1.2.1 Ensure audit log storage size is configured (Automated)
Profile Applicability:

• Level 2 - Server
• Level 2 - Workstation

Description:

Configure the maximum size of the audit log file. Once the log reaches the maximum size, it
will be rotated and a new log file will be started.

Notes:

   •     The max_log_file parameter is measured in megabytes.
   •     Other methods of log rotation may be appropriate based on site policy. One example is
         time-based rotation strategies which don't have native support in auditd
         configurations. Manual audit of custom configurations should be evaluated for
         effectiveness and completeness.

Rationale:

It is important that an appropriate size is determined for log files so that they do not impact
the system and audit data is not lost.

Run the following command and ensure output is in compliance with site policy:

# grep max_log_file /etc/audit/auditd.conf

Rationale:

During boot if audit=1, then the backlog will hold 64 records. If more that 64 records are

undetected.

Audit:

Run the following commands and verify the audit_backlog_limit= parameter is set to an
appropriate size for your organization

# grep "^\s*linux" /boot/grub2/grub.cfg | grep -v "audit_backlog_limit="

4.1.3 Ensure events that modify date and time information are collected
(Automated)
Profile Applicability:

• Level 2 - Server
• Level 2 - Workstation

Description:

Capture events where the system date and/or time has been modified. The parameters in
this section are set to determine if the adjtimex (tune kernel clock), settimeofday (Set
time, using timeval and timezone structures) stime (using seconds since 1/1/1970) or
clock_settime (allows for the setting of several internal clocks and timers) system calls
have been executed and always write an audit record to the /var/log/audit.log file upon
exit, tagging the records with the identifier "time-change"

Note: Reloading the auditd config to set active settings requires the auditd service to be
restarted, and may require a system reboot.

Rationale:

Unexpected changes in system date and/or time could be a sign of malicious activity on the
system.

4.1.4 Ensure events that modify user/group information are collected
(Automated)
Profile Applicability:

• Level 2 - Server
• Level 2 - Workstation

Description:

Record events affecting the group , passwd (user IDs), shadow and gshadow (passwords) or
/etc/security/opasswd (old passwords, based on remember parameter in the PAM
configuration) files. The parameters in this section will watch the files to see if they have
been opened for write or have had attribute changes (e.g. permissions) and tag them with
the identifier "identity" in the audit log file.

Note: Reloading the auditd config to set active settings may require a system reboot.

Rationale:

Unexpected changes to these files could be an indication that the system has been
compromised and that an unauthorized user is attempting to hide their activities or
compromise additional accounts.

Audit:

Run the following command and verify rules are in a .rules file:

# grep identity /etc/audit/rules.d/*.rules

Verify the output matches:

/etc/audit/rules.d/identity.rules:-w         /etc/group -p wa -k identity

4.1.5 Ensure events that modify the system's network environment are
collected (Automated)
Profile Applicability:

• Level 2 - Server
• Level 2 - Workstation

Description:

Record changes to network environment files or system calls. The below parameters
monitor the sethostname (set the systems host name) or setdomainname (set the systems
domainname) system calls, and write an audit event on system call exit. The other
parameters monitor the /etc/issue and /etc/issue.net files (messages displayed pre-
login), /etc/hosts (file containing host names and associated IP addresses) and
/etc/sysconfig/network (directory containing network interface scripts and
configurations) files.

Note: Reloading the auditd config to set active settings requires the auditd service to be
restarted, and may require a system reboot.

Rationale:

Monitoring sethostname and setdomainname will identify potential unauthorized changes
to host and domainname of a system. The changing of these names could potentially break
security parameters that are set based on those names. The /etc/hosts file is monitored
for changes in the file that can indicate an unauthorized intruder is trying to change
machine associations with IP addresses and trick users and processes into connecting to
unintended machines. Monitoring /etc/issue and /etc/issue.net is important, as
intruders could put disinformation into those files and trick users into providing
information to the intruder. Monitoring /etc/sysconfig/network is important as it can
show if network interfaces or scripts are being modified in a way that can lead to the
machine becoming unavailable or compromised. All audit records will be tagged with the
identifier "system-locale."

Rationale:

Changes to files in the /etc/selinux/ and /usr/share/selinux/ directories could indicate
that an unauthorized user is attempting to modify access controls and change security
contexts, leading to a compromise of the system.

Profile Applicability:

• Level 2 - Server
• Level 2 - Workstation

Description:

Monitor login and logout events. The parameters below track changes to files associated
with login/logout events.

   •   The file /var/log/faillog tracks failed events from login.
   •   The file /var/log/lastlog maintain records of the last time a user successfully
       logged in.
   •   The file /var/log/tallylog maintains records of failures via the pam_tally2

Note: Reloading the auditd config to set active settings requires the auditd service to be
restarted, and may require a system reboot.

Rationale:

Monitoring login/logout events could provide a system administrator with information
associated with brute force attacks against user logins.

4.1.8 Ensure session initiation information is collected (Automated)
Profile Applicability:

• Level 2 - Server
• Level 2 - Workstation

Description:

Monitor session initiation events. The parameters in this section track changes to the files
associated with session events. The file /var/run/utmp tracks all currently logged in users.
All audit records will be tagged with the identifier "session." The /var/log/wtmp file tracks
logins, logouts, shutdown, and reboot events. The file /var/log/btmp keeps track of failed
login attempts and can be read by entering the command /usr/bin/last -f
/var/log/btmp . All audit records will be tagged with the identifier "logins."

Notes:

   •     The last command can be used to read /var/log/wtmp (last with no parameters)
         and /var/run/utmp (last -f /var/run/utmp)
   •     Reloading the auditd config to set active settings requires the auditd service to be
         restarted, and may require a system reboot.

Rationale:

Monitoring these files for changes could alert a system administrator to logins occurring at
unusual hours, which could indicate intruder activity (i.e. a user logging in at a time when
they do not normally log in).

4.1.9 Ensure discretionary access control permission modification events
are collected (Automated)
Profile Applicability:

• Level 2 - Server
• Level 2 - Workstation

Description:

Monitor changes to file permissions, attributes, ownership and group. The parameters in
this section track changes for system calls that affect file permissions and attributes. The
chmod , fchmod and fchmodat system calls affect the permissions associated with a file. The
chown , fchown , fchownat and lchown system calls affect owner and group attributes on a
file. The setxattr , lsetxattr , fsetxattr (set extended file attributes) and removexattr ,
lremovexattr , fremovexattr (remove extended file attributes) control extended file
attributes. In all cases, an audit record will only be written for non-system user ids (auid >=
1000) and will ignore Daemon events (auid = 4294967295). All audit records will be
tagged with the identifier "perm_mod."

Notes:

   •     Systems may have been customized to change the default UID_MIN. To confirm the
         UID_MIN for your system, run the following command:
   •     awk '/^\s*UID_MIN/{print $2}' /etc/login.defs
   •     If your systems' UID_MIN is not 1000, replace audit>=1000 with audit>=<UID_MIN
         for your system> in the Audit and Remediation procedures.
   •     Reloading the auditd config to set active settings may require a system reboot.

Rationale:

Monitoring for changes in file attributes could alert a system administrator to activity that
could indicate intruder activity or policy violation.




                                                                                   334 | P a g e

4.1.10 Ensure unsuccessful unauthorized file access attempts are
collected (Automated)
Profile Applicability:

• Level 2 - Server
• Level 2 - Workstation

Description:

Monitor for unsuccessful attempts to access files. The parameters below are associated
with system calls that control creation ( creat ), opening ( open , openat ) and truncation (
truncate , ftruncate ) of files. An audit log record will only be written if the user is a non-
privileged user (auid > = 1000), is not a Daemon event (auid=4294967295) and if the
system call returned EACCES (permission denied to the file) or EPERM (some other
permanent error associated with the specific system call). All audit records will be tagged
with the identifier "access."

Notes:

   •     Systems may have been customized to change the default UID_MIN. To confirm the
         UID_MIN for your system, run the following command:
   •     # awk '/^\s*UID_MIN/{print $2}' /etc/login.defs
   •     If your systems' UID_MIN is not 1000, replace audit>=1000 with audit>=<UID_MIN for
         your system> in the Audit and Remediation procedures.
   •     Reloading the auditd config to set active settings may require a system reboot.

Rationale:

Failed attempts to open, create or truncate files could be an indication that an individual or
process is trying to gain unauthorized access to the system.

4.1.11 Ensure use of privileged commands is collected (Automated)
Profile Applicability:

• Level 2 - Server
• Level 2 - Workstation

Description:

Monitor privileged programs (those that have the setuid and/or setgid bit set on execution)
to determine if unprivileged users are running these commands.

Notes:

   •     Systems may have been customized to change the default UID_MIN. To confirm the
         UID_MIN for your system, run the following command:

  # awk '/^\s*UID_MIN/{print $2}' /etc/login.defs

   •     If your systems' UID_MIN is not 1000, replace audit>=1000 with audit>=<UID_MIN for
         your system> in the Audit and Remediation procedures.
   •     Reloading the auditd config to set active settings may require a system reboot.

Rationale:

Execution of privileged commands by non-privileged users could be an indication of
someone trying to gain unauthorized access to the system.

Audit:

Run the following command replacing <partition> with a list of partitions where
programs can be executed from on your system:

# find <partition> -xdev \( -perm -4000 -o -perm -2000 \) -type f | awk
'{print "-a always,exit -F path=" $1 " -F perm=x -F auid>='"$(awk
'/^\s*UID_MIN/{print $2}' /etc/login.defs)"' -F auid!=4294967295 -k
privileged" }'

Verify all resulting lines are a .rules file in /etc/audit/rules.d/ and the output of
auditctl -l.

Note: The .rules file output will be auid!=-1 not auid!=4294967295




                                                                                342 | P a g e
Remediation:

To remediate this issue, the system administrator will have to execute a find command to
locate all the privileged programs and then add an audit line for each one of them.
The audit parameters associated with this are as follows:

   •
        -F path=" $1 " - will populate each file name found through the find command and
        processed by awk.
   •
        -F perm=x - will write an audit record if the file is executed.
   •
        -F auid>=1000 - will write a record if the user executing the command is not a
        privileged user.
   •
        -F auid!= 4294967295 - will ignore Daemon events

All audit records should be tagged with the identifier "privileged".
Run the following command replacing with a list of partitions where programs can be
executed from on your system:

# find <partition> -xdev \( -perm -4000 -o -perm -2000 \) -type f | awk
'{print "-a always,exit -F path=" $1 " -F perm=x -F auid>='"$(awk
'/^\s*UID_MIN/{print $2}' /etc/login.defs)"' -F auid!=4294967295 -k
privileged" }'

Edit or create a file in the /etc/audit/rules.d/ directory ending in .rules and add all
resulting lines to the file.
Example:

# find / -xdev \( -perm -4000 -o -perm -2000 \) -type f | awk '{print "-a
always,exit -F path=" $1 " -F perm=x -F auid>='"$(awk '/^\s*UID_MIN/{print
$2}' /etc/login.defs)"' -F auid!=4294967295 -k privileged" }' >>

4.1.12 Ensure successful file system mounts are collected (Automated)
Profile Applicability:

• Level 2 - Server
• Level 2 - Workstation

Description:

Monitor the use of the mount system call. The mount (and umount ) system call controls the
mounting and unmounting of file systems. The parameters below configure the system to
create an audit record when the mount system call is used by a non-privileged user

Notes:

   •     Systems may have been customized to change the default UID_MIN. To confirm the
         UID_MIN for your system, run the following command:
   •     # awk '/^\s*UID_MIN/{print $2}' /etc/login.defs
   •     If your systems' UID_MIN is not 1000, replace audit>=1000 with audit>=<UID_MIN for
         your system> in the Audit and Remediation procedures.
   •     This tracks successful and unsuccessful mount commands.
   •     File system mounts do not have to come from external media and this action still does
         not verify write (e.g. CD ROMS).
   •     Reloading the auditd config to set active settings may require a system reboot.

Rationale:

It is highly unusual for a non-privileged user to mount file systems to the system. While
tracking mount commands gives the system administrator evidence that external media
may have been mounted (based on a review of the source of the mount and confirming it's
an external media type), it does not conclusively indicate that data was exported to the
media. System administrators who wish to determine if data were exported, would also
have to track successful open, creat and truncate system calls requiring write access to a
file under the mount point of the external media file system. This could give a fair
indication that a write occurred. The only way to truly prove it, would be to track
successful writes to the external media. Tracking write system calls could quickly fill up the
audit log and is not recommended. Recommendations on configuration options to track
data export to media is beyond the scope of this document.

4.1.13 Ensure file deletion events by users are collected (Automated)
Profile Applicability:

• Level 2 - Server
• Level 2 - Workstation

Description:

Monitor the use of system calls associated with the deletion or renaming of files and file
attributes. This configuration statement sets up monitoring for following system calls and
tags them with the identifier "delete":

   •     unlink - remove a file
   •     unlinkat - remove a file attribute
   •     rename - rename a file
   •     renameat - rename a file attribute

Notes:

   •     Systems may have been customized to change the default UID_MIN. To confirm the
         UID_MIN for your system, run the following command:
   •     # awk '/^\s*UID_MIN/{print $2}' /etc/login.defs
   •     If your systems' UID_MIN is not 1000, replace audit>=1000 with audit>=<UID_MIN for
         your system> in the Audit and Remediation procedures.
   •     At a minimum, configure the audit system to collect file deletion events for all users
         and root.
   •     Reloading the auditd config to set active settings may require a system reboot.

Rationale:

Monitoring these calls from non-privileged users could provide a system administrator
with evidence that inappropriate removal of files and file attributes associated with
protected files is occurring. While this audit option will look at all events, system
administrators will want to look for specific privileged files that are being deleted or
altered.

4.1.14 Ensure changes to system administration scope (sudoers) is
collected (Automated)
Profile Applicability:

• Level 2 - Server
• Level 2 - Workstation

Description:

Monitor scope changes for system administrators. If the system has been properly
configured to force system administrators to log in as themselves first and then use the
sudo command to execute privileged commands, it is possible to monitor changes in scope.
The file /etc/sudoers or a file in the /etc/sudoers.d directory will be written to when the
file or its attributes have changed.

Notes: Reloading the auditd config to set active settings may require a system reboot.

Rationale:

Changes in the /etc/sudoers file, or a file in the /etc/sudoers.d/ directory can indicate
that an unauthorized change has been made to scope of system administrator activity.

Audit:

Run the following commands:
Run the following command and verify rules are in a .rules file:

# grep scope /etc/audit/rules.d/*.rules

Verify output matches:

/etc/audit/rules.d/scope.rules:-w /etc/sudoers -p wa -k scope
/etc/audit/rules.d/scope.rules:-w /etc/sudoers.d/ -p wa -k scope

Run the following command and verify the rules are in the running auditd config:

# auditctl -l | grep scope

Verify output matches:

-w /etc/sudoers -p wa -k scope
-w /etc/sudoers.d -p wa -k scope

4.1.15 Ensure system administrator actions (sudolog) are collected
(Automated)
Profile Applicability:

• Level 2 - Server
• Level 2 - Workstation

Description:

Monitor the sudo log file. The sudo log file is configured in /etc/sudoers or a file in
/etc/sudoers.d.
If the system has been properly configured to disable the use of the su command and force
all administrators to have to log in first and then use sudo to execute privileged commands,
then all administrator commands will be logged to to the sudo log file. Any time a command
is executed, an audit event will be triggered as the sudo log file will be opened for write and
the executed administration command will be written to the log.

Notes:

   •     The system must be configured with su disabled (See Item 5.6 Ensure access to the su
         command is restricted) to force all command execution through sudo. This will not be
         effective on the console, as administrators can log in as root.
   •     Reloading the auditd config to set active settings may require a system reboot.

Rationale:

Changes in /var/log/sudo.log indicate that an administrator has executed a command or
the log file itself has been tampered with. Administrators will want to correlate the events
written to the audit trail with the records written to /var/log/sudo.log to verify if
unauthorized commands have been executed.




                                                                                 352 | P a g e

/etc/audit/rules.d/*.rules

# auditctl -l | grep actions

Verify output of both matches the output of the following command, and the the output
includes a file path

echo "-w $(grep -r logfile /etc/sudoers* | sed -e 's/.*logfile=//;s/,? .*//')

Edit or create a file in the /etc/audit/rules.d/ directory ending in .rules and add the
following line:

-w <Path to sudo logfile> -p wa -k actions

Example: vi /etc/audit/rules.d/actions.rules

4.1.16 Ensure kernel module loading and unloading is collected
(Automated)
Profile Applicability:

• Level 2 - Server
• Level 2 - Workstation

Description:

Monitor the loading and unloading of kernel modules. The programs insmod (install a
kernel module), rmmod (remove a kernel module), and modprobe (a more sophisticated
program to load and unload modules, as well as some other features) control loading and
unloading of modules. The init_module (load a module) and delete_module (delete a
module) system calls control loading and unloading of modules. Any execution of the
loading and unloading module programs and system calls will trigger an audit record with
an identifier of "modules".

Note: Reloading the auditd config to set active settings requires the auditd service to be
restarted, and may require a system reboot.

Rationale:

Monitoring the use of insmod , rmmod and modprobe could provide system administrators
with evidence that an unauthorized user loaded or unloaded a kernel module, possibly
compromising the security of the system. Monitoring of the init_module and
delete_module system calls would reflect an unauthorized user attempting to use a
different program to load and unload modules.

4.1.17 Ensure the audit configuration is immutable (Automated)
Profile Applicability:

• Level 2 - Server
• Level 2 - Workstation

Description:

Set system audit so that audit rules cannot be modified with auditctl . Setting the flag "-e
2" forces audit to be put in immutable mode. Audit changes can only be made on system
reboot.

Note: This setting will require the system to be rebooted to update the active auditd
configuration settings.

Rationale:

In immutable mode, unauthorized users cannot execute changes to the audit system to
potentially hide malicious activity and then put the audit rules back. Users would most
likely notice a system reboot and that could alert administrators of an attempt to make
unauthorized audit changes.

Description:

rsyslog needs to be enabled and running to perform logging

Rationale:

If the rsyslog service is not activated the system may default to the syslogd service or lack
logging instead.

Audit:

Run one of the following commands to verify rsyslog is enabled:

# systemctl is-enabled rsyslog

Run the following command to verify that rsyslog is running:

# systemctl status rsyslog | grep 'active (running) '

4.2.1.3 Ensure rsyslog default file permissions configured (Automated)
Profile Applicability:

• Level 1 - Server
• Level 1 - Workstation

Description:

rsyslog will create logfiles that do not already exist on the system. This setting controls
what permissions will be applied to these newly created files.
The $FileCreateMode parameter specifies the file creation mode with which rsyslogd
creates new files. If not specified, the value 0644 is used.

Notes:

   •     The value given must always be a 4-digit octal number, with the initial digit being
         zero.
   •     This setting can be overridden by a less restrictive setting in any file ending in .conf in
         the /etc/rsyslog.d/ directory

Rationale:

It is important to ensure that log files have the correct permissions to ensure that sensitive
data is archived and protected.

Audit:

Run the following command and verify that $FileCreateMode is 0640 or more restrictive:

# grep ^\$FileCreateMode /etc/rsyslog.conf /etc/rsyslog.d/*.conf

$FileCreateMode 0640

Verify that no results return with a less restrictive file mode

Remediation:

Edit the /etc/rsyslog.conf and /etc/rsyslog.d/*.conf files and set $FileCreateMode to
0640 or more restrictive:

$FileCreateMode 0640

4.2.1.4 Ensure logging is configured (Manual)
Profile Applicability:

• Level 1 - Server
• Level 1 - Workstation

Description:

The /etc/rsyslog.conf and /etc/rsyslog.d/*.conf files specifies rules for logging and
which files are to be used to log certain classes of messages.

Rationale:

A great deal of important security-related information is sent via rsyslog (e.g., successful
and failed su attempts, failed login attempts, root login attempts, etc.).

Audit:

Review the contents of the /etc/rsyslog.conf and /etc/rsyslog.d/*.conf files to ensure
appropriate logging is set. In addition, run the following command and verify that the log
files are logging information:

# ls -l /var/log/

4.2.1.5 Ensure rsyslog is configured to send logs to a remote log host
(Automated)
Profile Applicability:

• Level 1 - Server
• Level 1 - Workstation

Description:

The rsyslog utility supports the ability to send logs it gathers to a remote log host running
syslogd(8) or to receive messages from remote hosts, reducing administrative overhead.

Note: The double "at" sign (@@) directs rsyslog to use TCP to send log messages to the server,
which is a more reliable transport mechanism than the default UDP protocol

Rationale:

Storing log data on a remote host protects log integrity from local attacks. If an attacker
gains root access on the local system, they could tamper with or remove log data that is
stored on the local system

Audit:

Review the /etc/rsyslog.conf and /etc/rsyslog.d/*.conf files and verify that logs are
sent to a central host (where loghost.example.com is the name of your central log host):

# grep "^*.*[^I][^I]*@" /etc/rsyslog.conf /etc/rsyslog.d/*.conf

*.* @@loghost.example.com

4.2.1.6 Ensure remote rsyslog messages are only accepted on
designated log hosts. (Manual)
Profile Applicability:

• Level 1 - Server
• Level 1 - Workstation

Description:

By default, rsyslog does not listen for log messages coming in from remote systems. The
ModLoad tells rsyslog to load the imtcp.so module so it can listen over a network via TCP.
The InputTCPServerRun option instructs rsyslogd to listen on the specified TCP port.

Note: The $ModLoad imtcp line can have the .so extension added to the end of the module, or
use the full path to the module.

Rationale:

The guidance in the section ensures that remote log hosts are configured to only accept
rsyslog data from hosts within the specified domain and that those systems that are not
designed to be log hosts do not accept any remote rsyslog messages. This provides
protection from spoofed log data and ensures that system administrators are reviewing
reasonably complete syslog data in a central location.

Audit:

Run the following commands and verify the resulting lines are uncommitted on designated
log hosts and commented or removed on all others:

# grep '$ModLoad imtcp' /etc/rsyslog.conf /etc/rsyslog.d/*.conf

$ModLoad imtcp

# grep '$InputTCPServerRun' /etc/rsyslog.conf /etc/rsyslog.d/*.conf

$InputTCPServerRun 514

Remediation:

For hosts that are designated as log hosts, edit the /etc/rsyslog.conf file and un-
comment or add the following lines:

$ModLoad imtcp

$InputTCPServerRun 514

For hosts that are not designated as log hosts, edit the /etc/rsyslog.conf file and

4.2.2 Configure journald
systemd-journald is a system service that collects and stores logging data. It creates and
maintains structured, indexed journals based on logging information that is received from
a variety of sources: Kernel log messages, via kmsg

Any changes made to the systemd-journald configuration will require a re-start of systemd-
journald

4.2.2.1 Ensure journald is configured to send logs to rsyslog
(Automated)
Profile Applicability:

• Level 1 - Server
• Level 1 - Workstation

Description:

Data from journald may be stored in volatile memory or persisted locally on the server.
Utilities exist to accept remote export of journald logs, however, use of the rsyslog service
provides a consistent means of log collection and export.

Notes:

   •     This recommendation assumes that recommendation 4.2.1.5, "Ensure rsyslog is
         configured to send logs to a remote log host" has been implemented.
   •     The main configuration file /etc/systemd/journald.conf is read before any of the
         custom *.conf files. If there are custom configs present, they override the main
         configuration parameters
   •     As noted in the journald man pages: journald logs may be exported to rsyslog either
         through the process mentioned here, or through a facility like systemd-
         journald.service. There are trade-offs involved in each implementation, where
         ForwardToSyslog will immediately capture all events (and forward to an external log
         server, if properly configured), but may not capture all boot-up activities. Mechanisms
         such as systemd-journald.service, on the other hand, will record bootup events, but
         may delay sending the information to rsyslog, leading to the potential for log
         manipulation prior to export. Be aware of the limitations of all tools employed to
         secure a system.

Rationale:

Storing log data on a remote host protects log integrity from local attacks. If an attacker
gains root access on the local system, they could tamper with or remove log data that is
stored on the local system.

Audit:

Review /etc/systemd/journald.conf and verify that logs are forwarded to syslog

# grep -E ^\s*ForwardToSyslog /etc/systemd/journald.conf

ForwardToSyslog=yes




                                                                                   374 | P a g e

4.2.2.2 Ensure journald is configured to compress large log files
(Automated)
Profile Applicability:

• Level 1 - Server
• Level 1 - Workstation

Description:

The journald system includes the capability of compressing overly large files to avoid filling
up the system with logs or making the log's size unmanageable.

Note: The main configuration file /etc/systemd/journald.conf is read before any of the
custom *.conf files. If there are custom configs present, they override the main configuration
parameters

Rationale:

Uncompressed large files may unexpectedly fill a filesystem leading to resource
unavailability. Compressing logs prior to write can prevent sudden, unexpected filesystem
impacts.

Audit:

Review /etc/systemd/journald.conf and verify that large files will be compressed:

# grep -E ^\s*Compress /etc/systemd/journald.conf

Compress=yes

Remediation:

Edit the /etc/systemd/journald.conf file and add the following line:

Compress=yes

4.2.2.3 Ensure journald is configured to write logfiles to persistent disk
(Automated)
Profile Applicability:

• Level 1 - Server
• Level 1 - Workstation

Description:

Data from journald may be stored in volatile memory or persisted locally on the server.
Logs in memory will be lost upon a system reboot. By persisting logs to local disk on the
server they are protected from loss.

Note: The main configuration file /etc/systemd/journald.conf is read before any of the
custom *.conf files. If there are custom configs present, they override the main configuration
parameters

Rationale:

Writing log data to disk will provide the ability to forensically reconstruct events which
may have impacted the operations or security of a system even after a system crash or
reboot.

Audit:

Review /etc/systemd/journald.conf and verify that logs are persisted to disk:

# grep -E ^\s*Storage /etc/systemd/journald.conf

Storage=persistent

Remediation:

Edit the /etc/systemd/journald.conf file and add the following line:

4.2.3 Ensure permissions on all logfiles are configured (Automated)
Profile Applicability:

• Level 1 - Server
• Level 1 - Workstation

Description:

Log files stored in /var/log/ contain logged information from many services on the system,
or on log hosts others as well.

Rationale:

It is important to ensure that log files have the correct permissions to ensure that sensitive
data is archived and protected. Other/world should not have the ability to view this
information. Group should not have the ability to modify this information.

Audit:

Run the following command and verify that other has no permissions on any files and
group does not have write or execute permissions on any files:

#    find /var/log -type f -perm /g+wx,o+rwx                        -exec ls -l {} \;

Nothing should be returned

Remediation:

Run the following commands to set permissions on all existing log files:

find /var/log -type f -exec chmod g-wx,o-rwx "{}" + -o -type d -exec chmod g-
wx,o-rwx "{}" +

Note: The configuration for your logging software or services may need to also be modified for
any logs that had incorrect permissions, otherwise, the permissions may be reverted to the
incorrect permissions

4.2.4 Ensure logrotate is configured (Manual)
Profile Applicability:

• Level 1 - Server
• Level 1 - Workstation

Description:

The system includes the capability of rotating log files regularly to avoid filling up the
system with logs or making the log's size unmanageable. The file
/etc/logrotate.d/syslog is the configuration file used to rotate log files created by
syslog or rsyslog.

Note: If no maxage setting is set for logrotate a situation can occur where logrotate is
interrupted and fails to delete rotated logfiles. It is recommended to set this to a value greater
than the longest any log file should exist on your system to ensure that any such logfile is
removed but standard rotation settings are not overridden.

Rationale:

By keeping the log files smaller and more manageable, a system administrator can easily
archive these files to another system and spend less time looking through inordinately
large log files.

Audit:

Review /etc/logrotate.conf and /etc/logrotate.d/* and verify logs are rotated
according to site policy.

Remediation:

Edit /etc/logrotate.conf and /etc/logrotate.d/* to ensure logs are rotated according

•   Access - Access control for an operating system determines how the operating
    system implements accesses to system resources by satisfying the security
    objectives of integrity, availability, and secrecy
•   Authentication - Authentication is the process of recognizing a user's identity
•   Authorization - Authorization is a security mechanism to determine access levels or
    user/client privileges related to system resources including files, services, computer
    programs, data and application features

5.1 Configure time-based job schedulers
cron is a time-based job scheduler used to schedule jobs, commands or shell scripts, to run
periodically at fixed times, dates, or intervals.
at provides the ability to execute a command or shell script at a specified date and hour, or
after a given interval of time.
Other methods exist for scheduling jobs, such as systemd timers. If another method is
used, it should be secured in accordance with local site policy

Note: systemd timers are systemd unit files whose name ends in .timer that control
.service files or events. Timers can be used as an alternative to cron and at. Timers have
built-in support for calendar time events, monotonic time events, and can be run
asynchronously

If cron and at are not installed, this section can be skipped.

5.1.1 Ensure cron daemon is enabled and running (Automated)
Profile Applicability:

• Level 1 - Server
• Level 1 - Workstation

Description:

The cron daemon is used to execute batch jobs on the system.

Rationale:

While there may not be user jobs that need to be run on the system, the system does have
maintenance jobs that may include security monitoring that have to run. If another method
for scheduling tasks is not being used, cron is used to execute them, and needs to be
enabled and running.

Audit:

If cron is installed:
Run the following commands to verify cron is enabled and running:

# systemctl is-enabled cron

5.1.2 Ensure permissions on /etc/crontab are configured (Automated)
Profile Applicability:

Description:

The /etc/crontab file is used by cron to control its own jobs. The commands in this item
make sure that root is the user and group owner of the file and that only the owner can
access the file.

Rationale:

This file contains information on what system jobs are run by cron. Write access to these
files could provide unprivileged users with the ability to elevate their privileges. Read
access to these files could provide users with the ability to gain insight on system jobs that
run on the system and could provide them a way to gain unauthorized privileged access.

Audit:

If cron is installed:

Run the following command and verify Uid and Gid are both 0/root and Access does not

(Automated)
Profile Applicability:

• Level 1 - Server
• Level 1 - Workstation

Description:

The /etc/cron.weekly directory contains system cron jobs that need to run on a weekly
basis. The files in this directory cannot be manipulated by the crontab command, but are
instead edited by system administrators using a text editor. The commands below restrict
read/write and search access to user and group root, preventing regular users from
accessing this directory.

Rationale:

Granting write access to this directory for non-privileged users could provide them the
means for gaining unauthorized elevated privileges. Granting read access to this directory
could give an unprivileged user insight in how to gain elevated privileges or circumvent
auditing controls.

Audit:

If cron is installed

Run the following command and verify Uid and Gid are both 0/root and Access does not
grant permissions to group or other :

# stat /etc/cron.weekly

5.1.8 Ensure cron is restricted to authorized users (Automated)
Profile Applicability:

• Level 1 - Server
• Level 1 - Workstation

Description:

If cron is installed in the system, configure /etc/cron.allow to allow specific users to use
these services. If /etc/cron.allow does not exist, then /etc/cron.deny is checked. Any
user not specifically defined in those files is allowed to use cron. By removing the file, only
users in /etc/cron.allow are allowed to use cron.

Note: Even though a given user is not listed in cron.allow, cron jobs can still be run as that
user. The cron.allow file only controls administrative access to the crontab command for
scheduling and modifying cron jobs.

Rationale:

On many systems, only the system administrator is authorized to schedule cron jobs. Using
the cron.allow file to control who can run cron jobs enforces this policy. It is easier to
manage an allow list than a deny list. In a deny list, you could potentially add a user ID to
the system and forget to add it to the deny files.

5.2 Configure SSH Server
SSH is a secure, encrypted replacement for common login services such as telnet, ftp,
rlogin, rsh, and rcp. It is strongly recommended that sites abandon older clear-text login
protocols and use SSH to prevent session hijacking and sniffing of sensitive data off the
network.

Notes:

   •     The recommendations in this section only apply if the SSH daemon is installed on the
         system, if remote access is not required the SSH daemon can be removed and this
         section skipped
   •     Once all configuration changes have been made to /etc/ssh/sshd_config, the sshd
         configuration must be reloaded

# systemctl reload sshd

keys need to be stored and handled carefully, and no copies of the private key should be
distributed.

If an unauthorized user obtains the private SSH host key file, the host could be

5.2.3 Ensure permissions on SSH public host key files are configured
(Automated)
Profile Applicability:

• Level 1 - Server
• Level 1 - Workstation

Description:

An SSH public key is one of two files used in SSH public key authentication. In this
authentication method, a public key is a key that can be used for verifying digital signatures
generated using a corresponding private key. Only a public key that corresponds to a
private key will be able to authenticate successfully.

Rationale:

If a public host key file is modified by an unauthorized user, the SSH service may be
compromised.

5.2.4 Ensure SSH access is limited (Automated)
Profile Applicability:

• Level 1 - Server
• Level 1 - Workstation

Description:

There are several options available to limit which users and group can access the system
via SSH. It is recommended that at least one of the following options be leveraged:

   •   AllowUsers:
          o The AllowUsers variable gives the system administrator the option of
             allowing specific users to ssh into the system. The list consists of space
             separated user names. Numeric user IDs are not recognized with this
             variable. If a system administrator wants to restrict user access further by
             only allowing the allowed users to log in from a particular host, the entry can
             be specified in the form of user@host.
   •   AllowGroups:
          o The AllowGroups variable gives the system administrator the option of
             allowing specific groups of users to ssh into the system. The list consists of
             space separated group names. Numeric group IDs are not recognized with
             this variable.
   •   DenyUsers:
          o The DenyUsers variable gives the system administrator the option of denying
             specific users to ssh into the system. The list consists of space separated user
             names. Numeric user IDs are not recognized with this variable. If a system
             administrator wants to restrict user access further by specifically denying a
             user's access from a particular host, the entry can be specified in the form of
             user@host.
   •   DenyGroups:
          o The DenyGroups variable gives the system administrator the option of
             denying specific groups of users to ssh into the system. The list consists of
             space separated group names. Numeric group IDs are not recognized with
             this variable.

Rationale:

Restricting which users can remotely access the system via SSH will help ensure that only
authorized users access the system.




                                                                                409 | P a g e

allowusers <userlist>
allowgroups <grouplist>
denyusers <userlist>
denygroups <grouplist>

5.2.5 Ensure SSH LogLevel is appropriate (Automated)
Profile Applicability:

• Level 1 - Server
• Level 1 - Workstation

Description:

INFO level is the basic level that only records login activity of SSH users. In many situations,
such as Incident Response, it is important to determine when a particular user was active
on a system. The logout record can eliminate those users who disconnected, which helps
narrow the field.
VERBOSE level specifies that login and logout activity as well as the key fingerprint for any
SSH key used for login will be logged. This information is important for SSH key
management, especially in legacy environments.

Rationale:

SSH provides several logging levels with varying amounts of verbosity. DEBUG is specifically
not recommended other than strictly for debugging SSH communications since it provides
so much data that it is difficult to identify important security information.

Audit:

Run the following command and verify that output matches:

# sshd -T | grep loglevel

loglevel VERBOSE

OR

loglevel INFO

Remediation:

5.2.6 Ensure SSH X11 forwarding is disabled (Automated)
Profile Applicability:

• Level 1 - Workstation

Rationale:

Disable X11 forwarding unless there is an operational requirement to use X11 applications
directly. There is a small risk that the remote X11 servers of users who are logged in via
SSH with X11 forwarding could be compromised by other users on the X11 server. Note
that even if X11 forwarding is disabled, users can always install their own forwarders.

5.2.7 Ensure SSH MaxAuthTries is set to 4 or less (Automated)
Profile Applicability:

• Level 1 - Server
• Level 1 - Workstation

Description:

The MaxAuthTries parameter specifies the maximum number of authentication attempts
permitted per connection. When the login failure count reaches half the number, error
messages will be written to the syslog file detailing the login failure.

Rationale:

Setting the MaxAuthTries parameter to a low number will minimize the risk of successful
brute force attacks to the SSH server. While the recommended setting is 4, set the number
based on site policy.

Audit:

Run the following command and verify that output MaxAuthTries is 4 or less:

# sshd -T | grep maxauthtries

maxauthtries 4

Remediation:

Edit the /etc/ssh/sshd_config file to set the parameter as follows:

MaxAuthTries 4

Default Value:

MaxAuthTries 6

Description:

The HostbasedAuthentication parameter specifies if authentication is allowed through
trusted hosts via the user of .rhosts, or /etc/hosts.equiv, along with successful public
key client host authentication. This option only applies to SSH Protocol Version 2.

Rationale:

Even though the .rhosts files are ineffective if support is disabled in /etc/pam.conf,
disabling the ability to use .rhosts files in SSH provides an additional layer of protection.

Description:

The PermitRootLogin parameter specifies if the root user can log in using ssh. The default
is no.

Rationale:

Disallowing root logins over SSH requires system admins to authenticate using their own
individual account, then escalating to root via sudo or su. This in turn limits opportunity for
non-repudiation and provides a clear audit trail in the event of a security incident

Notes:

   •     Some organizations may have stricter requirements for approved ciphers. Ensure that
         ciphers used are in compliance with site policy
   •     The only "strong" ciphers currently FIPS 140-2 compliant are: aes256-ctr,aes192-
         ctr,aes128-ctr
   •     CVE-2013-4548 referenced bellow applies to OpenSSH versions 6.2 and 6.3. If running
         these versions of Open SSH, Please upgrade to version 6.4 or later to fix the
         vulnerability, or disable AES-GCM in the server configuration

3des-cbc

aes128-cbc

aes192-cbc

aes256-cbc

aes128-ctr

Rationale:

Weak ciphers that are used for authentication to the cryptographic module cannot be relied
upon to provide confidentiality or integrity, and system data may be compromised.

   •     The DES, Triple DES, and Blowfish ciphers, as used in SSH, have a birthday bound of
         approximately four billion blocks, which makes it easier for remote attackers to
         obtain cleartext data via a birthday attack against a long-duration encrypted session,
         aka a "Sweet32" attack
   •     The RC4 algorithm, as used in the TLS protocol and SSL protocol, does not properly
         combine state data with key data during the initialization phase, which makes it
         easier for remote attackers to conduct plaintext-recovery attacks against the initial
         bytes of a stream by sniffing network traffic that occasionally relies on keys affected
         by the Invariance Weakness, and then using a brute-force approach involving LSB
         values, aka the "Bar Mitzvah" issue
   •     The passwords used during an SSH session encrypted with RC4 can be recovered by
         an attacker who is able to capture and replay the session
   •     Error handling in the SSH protocol; Client and Server, when using a block cipher
         algorithm in Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) mode, makes it easier for remote
         attackers to recover certain plaintext data from an arbitrary block of ciphertext in
         an SSH session via unknown vectors
   •     The mm_newkeys_from_blob function in monitor_wrap.c, when an AES-GCM cipher
         is used, does not properly initialize memory for a MAC context data structure, which
         allows remote authenticated users to bypass intended ForceCommand and login-
         shell restrictions via packet data that provides a crafted callback address

5.2.15 Ensure only strong Key Exchange algorithms are used
(Automated)
Profile Applicability:

• Level 1 - Server
• Level 1 - Workstation

Description:

Key exchange is any method in cryptography by which cryptographic keys are exchanged
between two parties, allowing use of a cryptographic algorithm. If the sender and receiver
wish to exchange encrypted messages, each must be equipped to encrypt messages to be
sent and decrypt messages received

Notes: Kex algorithms have a higher preference the earlier they appear in the list

   •   Some organizations may have stricter requirements for approved Key exchange
       algorithms. Ensure that Key exchange algorithms used are in compliance with site
       policy.
   •   The only Key Exchange Algorithms currently FIPS 140-2 approved are: ecdh-sha2-
       nistp256,ecdh-sha2-nistp384,ecdh-sha2-nistp521,diffie-hellman-group-exchange-

Rationale:

Key exchange methods that are considered weak should be removed. A key exchange
method may be weak because too few bits are used, or the hashing algorithm is considered
too weak. Using weak algorithms could expose connections to man-in-the-middle attacks

Audit:

Run the following command and verify that output does not contain any of the listed weak
Key Exchange algorithms

5.2.16 Ensure SSH Idle Timeout Interval is configured (Automated)
Profile Applicability:

• Level 1 - Server
• Level 1 - Workstation

Description:

The two options ClientAliveInterval and ClientAliveCountMax control the timeout of
ssh sessions.

   •   ClientAliveInterval sets a timeout interval in seconds after which if no data has
       been received from the client, sshd will send a message through the encrypted
       channel to request a response from the client. The default is 0, indicating that these
       messages will not be sent to the client.
   •   ClientAliveCountMax sets the number of client alive messages which may be sent
       without sshd receiving any messages back from the client. If this threshold is
       reached while client alive messages are being sent, sshd will disconnect the client,
       terminating the session. The default value is 3.
          o The client alive messages are sent through the encrypted channel
          o Setting ClientAliveCountMax to 0 disables connection termination

Example: If the ClientAliveInterval is set to 15 seconds and the ClientAliveCountMax is
set to 3, the client ssh session will be terminated after 45 seconds of idle time.

Rationale:

Having no timeout value associated with a connection could allow an unauthorized user
access to another user's ssh session (e.g. user walks away from their computer and doesn't
lock the screen). Setting a timeout value reduces this risk.

   •   The recommended ClientAliveInterval setting is 300 seconds (5 minutes)
   •   The recommended ClientAliveCountMax setting is 3
   •   The ssh session would send three keep alive messages at 5 minute intervals. If no
       response is received after the third keep alive message, the ssh session would be
       terminated after 15 minutes.




                                                                                 428 | P a g e
Audit:

Run the following commands and verify ClientAliveInterval is between 1 and 300:

# sshd -T | grep clientaliveinterval

clientaliveinterval 300

Run the following command and verify ClientAliveCountMax is between 1 and 3:

# sshd -T | grep clientalivecountmax

clientalivecountmax 3

Remediation:

Edit the /etc/ssh/sshd_config file to set the parameters according to site policy. This
should include ClientAliveInterval between 1 and 300 and ClientAliveCountMax of 3 or
less:

ClientAliveInterval 300

ClientAliveCountMax 3

Default Value:

ClientAliveInterval 0
ClientAliveCountMax 3

5.2.17 Ensure SSH LoginGraceTime is set to one minute or less
(Automated)
Profile Applicability:

• Level 1 - Server
• Level 1 - Workstation

Description:

The LoginGraceTime parameter specifies the time allowed for successful authentication to
the SSH server. The longer the Grace period is the more open unauthenticated connections
can exist. Like other session controls in this session the Grace Period should be limited to
appropriate organizational limits to ensure the service is available for needed access.

Rationale:

Setting the LoginGraceTime parameter to a low number will minimize the risk of successful
brute force attacks to the SSH server. It will also limit the number of concurrent
unauthenticated connections While the recommended setting is 60 seconds (1 Minute), set
the number based on site policy.

Audit:

Run the following command and verify that output LoginGraceTime is between 1 and 60:

# sshd -T | grep logingracetime

logingracetime 60

Remediation:

Edit the /etc/ssh/sshd_config file to set the parameter as follows:

5.2.19 Ensure SSH PAM is enabled (Automated)
Profile Applicability:

• Level 1 - Server

Description:

UsePAM Enables the Pluggable Authentication Module interface. If set to “yes” this will
enable PAM authentication using ChallengeResponseAuthentication and
PasswordAuthentication in addition to PAM account and session module processing for all
authentication types

Rationale:

When usePAM is set to yes, PAM runs through account and session types properly. This is
important if you want to restrict access to services based off of IP, time or other factors of
the account. Additionally, you can make sure users inherit certain environment variables
on login or disallow access to the server

Impact:

If UsePAM is enabled, you will not be able to run sshd(8) as a non-root user.

Audit:

Run the following command and verify that output matches:

# sshd -T | grep -i usepam

usepam yes

5.2.20 Ensure SSH AllowTcpForwarding is disabled (Automated)
Profile Applicability:

• Level 2 - Server
• Level 2 - Workstation

Description:

SSH port forwarding is a mechanism in SSH for tunneling application ports from the client
to the server, or servers to clients. It can be used for adding encryption to legacy
applications, going through firewalls, and some system administrators and IT professionals
use it for opening backdoors into the internal network from their home machines

Rationale:

Leaving port forwarding enabled can expose the organization to security risks and back-
doors.

SSH connections are protected with strong encryption. This makes their contents invisible
to most deployed network monitoring and traffic filtering solutions. This invisibility carries
considerable risk potential if it is used for malicious purposes such as data exfiltration.

Cybercriminals or malware could exploit SSH to hide their unauthorized communications,
or to exfiltrate stolen data from the target network

Impact:

SSH tunnels are widely used in many corporate environments that employ mainframe
systems as their application backends. In those environments the applications themselves
may have very limited native support for security. By utilizing tunneling, compliance with
SOX, HIPAA, PCI-DSS, and other standards can be achieved without having to modify the
applications.

Audit:

Run the following command and verify that output matches:

# sshd -T | grep -i allowtcpforwarding

allowtcpforwarding no

Remediation:

5.3 Configure PAM
PAM (Pluggable Authentication Modules) is a service that implements modular
authentication modules on UNIX systems. PAM is implemented as a set of shared objects
that are loaded and executed when a program needs to authenticate a user. Files for PAM
are typically located in the /etc/pam.d directory. PAM must be carefully configured to
secure system authentication. While this section covers some of PAM, please consult other
PAM resources to fully understand the configuration capabilities.




                                                                             439 | P a g e
5.3.1 Ensure password creation requirements are configured
(Automated)
Profile Applicability:

• Level 1 - Server
• Level 1 - Workstation

Description:

The pam_cracklib.so module checks the strength of passwords. It performs checks
including ensuring a password is not a dictionary word, it is a certain length, contains a mix
of characters (e.g. alphabet, numeric, other) and more.
The following are definitions of the pam_cracklib.so options:

   •   retry=3 - Allow 3 tries before sending back a failure.
   •   minlen=14 - password must be 14 characters or more
   •   dcredit=-1 - provide at least one digit
   •   ucredit=-1 - provide at least one uppercase character
   •   ocredit=-1 - provide at least one special character
   •   lcredit=-1 - provide at least one lowercase character

Additional module options may be set. This recommendation only covers:

   •   minlen=
   •   dcredit=
   •   ucredit=
   •   ocredit=
   •   lcredit=

NOTES: The settings shown above are one possible policy. If local site policy requires stricter
settings, alter these values to conform to your organization's password policies.

Rationale:

Strong passwords and limited attempts before locking an account protect systems from
being hacked through brute force methods.




                                                                                   440 | P a g e
Audit:

Verify password creation requirements conform to organization policy.

Run the following command to verify the minimum password length is at least 14
characters minlen=14:

# grep -P

5.3.2 Ensure lockout for failed password attempts is configured
(Automated)
Profile Applicability:

• Level 1 - Server
• Level 1 - Workstation

Description:

Lock out users after n unsuccessful consecutive login attempts.
These settings are commonly configured with the pam_faillock.so module. Some
environments may continue using the pam_tally2.so module, where this older method
may simplify automation in mixed environments.

Set the lockout number in deny= to the policy in effect at your site.
unlock_time=_n_ is the number of seconds the account remains locked after the number of
attempts configured in deny=_n_ has been met.

Notes:

   •     Additional module options may be set, recommendation only covers those listed here.
   •     If you want to require the administrator to unlock accounts, leave off the unlock_time
         option
   •     The default location for attempted accesses is recorded in /var/log/tallylog
   •     Use of the "audit" keyword may log credentials in the case of user error during
         authentication. This risk should be evaluated in the context of the site policies of your
         organization.
   •     You may also lock out root, this should be considered carefully due to the ability to
         have this setting lock all access to the system
             o As an option on the same line:
            o   auth required pam_tally2.so deny=5 even_deny_root unlock_time=900
            o   To define a different lockout time for root:
            o   auth required pam_tally2.so deny=5 root_unlock_time=120
                unlock_time=900
   •     If a user has been locked out because they have reached the maximum consecutive
         failure count defined by deny= in the pam_tally2.so module, the user can be unlocked
         by issuing following command. This command sets the failed count to 0, effectively
         unlocking the user.
   •     # pam_tally2 -u <username> --reset

Rationale:

Locking out user IDs after n unsuccessful consecutive login attempts mitigates brute force
password attacks against your systems.



                                                                                     443 | P a g e
Audit:

Verify password lockouts are configured. Ensure that the deny=_n_ follows local site policy.
This should not exceed deny=5.

Run the following commands:

# grep -E '^\s*auth\s+\S+\s+pam_(tally2|unix)\.so' /etc/pam.d/login

Verify the output includes the following lines:

auth          required         pam_tally2.so deny=5 onerr=fail unlock_time=900
auth          required         pam_unix.so try_first_pass

# grep -E '^\s*account\s+required\s+pam_tally2.so\s*' /etc/pam.d/common-
account

Verify the output includes the following lines:

account       required         pam_tally2.so

Remediation:

Modify the deny= and unlock_time= parameters to conform to local site policy, Not to be
greater than deny=5:

Edit the file /etc/pam.d/login and add the following line:

auth          required         pam_tally2.so deny=5 onerr=fail unlock_time=900

Note: The ordering on the lines is important. The additional line needs to below the line auth
required pam_env.so and above all password validation lines.

Example:

auth          required         pam_env.so
auth          required         pam_tally2.so deny=5 onerr=fail unlock_time=900
auth          sufficient       pam_unix.so nullok try_first_pass
auth          required         pam_deny.so

5.3.3 Ensure password reuse is limited (Automated)
Profile Applicability:

• Level 1 - Server
• Level 1 - Workstation

Description:

The /etc/security/opasswd file stores the users' old passwords and can be checked to
ensure that users are not recycling recent passwords.

Notes:

   •     Additional module options may be set, recommendation only covers those listed here.
   •     This setting only applies to local accounts.
   •     This option is configured with the remember=n module option in /etc/pam.d/common-

5.4.1.1 Ensure password hashing algorithm is SHA-512 (Automated)
Profile Applicability:

• Level 1 - Server
• Level 1 - Workstation

Description:

Login passwords are hashed and stored in the /etc/shadow file.

Note: These changes only apply to accounts configured on the local system.

Rationale:

The SHA-512 algorithm provides much stronger hashing than MD5, thus providing
additional protection to the system by increasing the level of effort for an attacker to
successfully determine passwords.

Audit:

Run the following command to verify the sha512 option is included:

# grep -Ei '^\s*^\s*ENCRYPT_METHOD\s+SHA512' /etc/login.defs

ENCRYPT_METHOD SHA512

Remediation:

Edit the /etc/login.defs file and modify ENCRYPT_METHOD to SHA512:

ENCRYPT_METHOD sha512

Notes:

   •
         Any system accounts that need to be expired should be carefully done separately by the
         system administrator to prevent any potential problems
   •
         If it is determined that the password algorithm being used is not SHA-512, once it is
         changed, it is recommended that all user ID's be immediately expired and forced to
         change their passwords on next login, In accordance with local site policies
   •
         To accomplish this, the following command can be used

         # awk -F: '( $3<'"$(awk '/^\s*UID_MIN/{print $2}' /etc/login.defs)"' &&
         $1 != "nfsnobody" ) { print $1 }' /etc/passwd | xargs -n 1 chage -d 0

5.4.1.2 Ensure password expiration is 365 days or less (Automated)
Profile Applicability:

• Level 1 - Server
• Level 1 - Workstation

Description:

The PASS_MAX_DAYS parameter in /etc/login.defs allows an administrator to force
passwords to expire once they reach a defined age. It is recommended that the
PASS_MAX_DAYS parameter be set to less than or equal to 365 days.

Notes:

   •     A value of -1 will disable password expiration.
   •     The password expiration must be greater than the minimum days between password
         changes or users will be unable to change their password.

Rationale:

The window of opportunity for an attacker to leverage compromised credentials via a
brute force attack, using already compromised credentials, or gaining the credentials by
other means, can be limited by the age of the password. Therefore, reducing the maximum
age of a password can also reduce an attacker's window of opportunity.

Requiring passwords to be changed helps to mitigate the risk posed by the poor security
practice of passwords being used for multiple accounts, and poorly implemented off-
boarding and change of responsibility policies. This should not be considered a
replacement for proper implementation of these policies and practices.

Note: If it is believed that a user's password may have been compromised, the user's account
should be locked immediately. Local policy should be followed to ensure the secure update of
their password.

5.4.1.3 Ensure minimum days between password changes is configured
(Automated)
Profile Applicability:

• Level 1 - Server
• Level 1 - Workstation

Description:

The PASS_MIN_DAYS parameter in /etc/login.defs allows an administrator to prevent
users from changing their password until a minimum number of days have passed since the
last time the user changed their password. It is recommended that PASS_MIN_DAYS
parameter be set to 1 or more days.

Rationale:

By restricting the frequency of password changes, an administrator can prevent users from
repeatedly changing their password in an attempt to circumvent password reuse controls.

Audit:

Run the following command and verify PASS_MIN_DAYS conforms to site policy (no less than
1 day):

# grep ^\s*PASS_MIN_DAYS /etc/login.defs

PASS_MIN_DAYS 1

Run the following command and Review list of users and PAS_MIN_DAYS to Verify that all

5.4.1.4 Ensure password expiration warning days is 7 or more
(Automated)
Profile Applicability:

• Level 1 - Server
• Level 1 - Workstation

Description:

The PASS_WARN_AGE parameter in /etc/login.defs allows an administrator to notify users
that their password will expire in a defined number of days. It is recommended that the
PASS_WARN_AGE parameter be set to 7 or more days.

Rationale:

Providing an advance warning that a password will be expiring gives users time to think of
a secure password. Users caught unaware may choose a simple password or write it down
where it may be discovered.

Audit:

Run the following command and verify PASS_WARN_AGE conforms to site policy (No less than
7 days):

# grep ^\s*PASS_WARN_AGE /etc/login.defs

PASS_WARN_AGE 7

Verify all users with a password have their number of days of warning before password
expires set to 7 or more:
Run the following command and Review list of users and PASS_WARN_AGE to verify that all
users' PASS_WARN_AGE conforms to site policy (No less than 7 days):

# grep -E ^[^:]+:[^\!*] /etc/shadow | cut -d: -f1,6

5.4.1.5 Ensure inactive password lock is 30 days or less (Automated)
Profile Applicability:

• Level 1 - Server

Description:

User accounts that have been inactive for over a given period of time can be automatically
disabled. It is recommended that accounts that are inactive for 30 days after password
expiration be disabled.

Note: A value of -1 would disable this setting.

Rationale:

Inactive accounts pose a threat to system security since the users are not logging in to
notice failed login attempts or other anomalies.

Audit:

Run the following command and verify INACTIVE conforms to sire policy (no more than 30
days):

# useradd -D | grep INACTIVE

5.4.2 Ensure system accounts are secured (Automated)
Profile Applicability:

• Level 1 - Server
• Level 1 - Workstation

Description:

There are a number of accounts provided with most distributions that are used to manage
applications and are not intended to provide an interactive shell.

Rationale:

It is important to make sure that accounts that are not being used by regular users are
prevented from being used to provide an interactive shell. By default, most distributions
set the password field for these accounts to an invalid string, but it is also recommended
that the shell field in the password file be set to the nologin shell. This prevents the
account from potentially being used to run any commands.

Note: The root, sync, shutdown, and halt users are exempted from requiring a non-login
shell.

Audit:

Run the following commands and verify no results are returned:

# awk -F: '($1!="root" && $1!="sync" && $1!="shutdown" && $1!="halt" &&
$1!~/^\+/ && $3<'"$(awk '/^\s*UID_MIN/{print $2}' /etc/login.defs)"' &&
$7!="'"$(which nologin)"'" && $7!="/bin/false") {print}' /etc/passwd

# awk -F: '($1!="root" && $1!~/^\+/ && $3<'"$(awk '/^\s*UID_MIN/{print $2}'
/etc/login.defs)"') {print $1}' /etc/passwd | xargs -I '{}' passwd -S '{}' |
awk '($2!="L" && $2!="LK") {print $1}'

Remediation:

Run the commands appropriate for your distribution:
Set the shell for any accounts returned by the audit to nologin:

# usermod -s $(which nologin) <user>

Lock any non root accounts returned by the audit:

# usermod -L <user>

The following command will set all system accounts to a non login shell:

# awk -F: '($1!="root" && $1!="sync" && $1!="shutdown" && $1!="halt" &&
$1!~/^\+/ && $3<'"$(awk '/^\s*UID_MIN/{print $2}' /etc/login.defs)"' &&
$7!="'"$(which nologin)"'" && $7!="/bin/false" && $7!="/usr/bin/false")
{print $1}' /etc/passwd | while read -r user; do usermod -s "$(which
nologin)" "$user"; done

The following command will automatically lock not root system accounts:

# awk -F: '($1!="root" && $1!~/^\+/ && $3<'"$(awk '/^\s*UID_MIN/{print $2}'
/etc/login.defs)"') {print $1}' /etc/passwd | xargs -I '{}' passwd -S '{}' |

5.4.3 Ensure default group for the root account is GID 0 (Automated)
Profile Applicability:

• Level 1 - Server
• Level 1 - Workstation

Description:

The usermod command can be used to specify which group the root user belongs to. This
affects permissions of files that are created by the root user.

Rationale:

Using GID 0 for the root account helps prevent root -owned files from accidentally
becoming accessible to non-privileged users.

Audit:

Run the following command and verify the result is 0 :

# grep "^root:" /etc/passwd | cut -f4 -d:

0

Remediation:

Run the following command to set the root user default group to GID 0 :

# usermod -g 0 root

5.4.4 Ensure default user shell timeout is configured (Automated)
Profile Applicability:

• Level 1 - Server
• Level 1 - Workstation

Description:

TMOUT is an environmental setting that determines the timeout of a shell in seconds.

   •   TMOUT=n - Sets the shell timeout to n seconds. A setting of TMOUT=0 disables
       timeout.
   •   readonly TMOUT- Sets the TMOUT environmental variable as readonly, preventing
       unwanted modification during run-time.
   •   export TMOUT - exports the TMOUT variable

System Wide Shell Configuration Files:

   •   /etc/profile - used to set system wide environmental variables on users shells.
       The variables are sometimes the same ones that are in the .bash_profile, however
       this file is used to set an initial PATH or PS1 for all shell users of the system. is only
       executed for interactive login shells, or shells executed with the --login
       parameter.
   •   /etc/profile.d - /etc/profile will execute the scripts within
       /etc/profile.d/*.sh. It is recommended to place your configuration in a shell
       script within /etc/profile.d to set your own system wide environmental variables.
   •   /etc/bash.bashrc - System wide version of .bashrc. etc/bashrc also invokes
       /etc/profile.d/*.sh if non-login shell, but redirects output to /dev/null if non-
       interactive. Is only executed for interactive shells or if BASH_ENV is set to
       /etc/bash.bashrc.

Rationale:

Setting a timeout value reduces the window of opportunity for unauthorized user access to
another user's shell session that has been left unattended. It also ends the inactive session
and releases the resources associated with that session.
Notes:

   •   The audit and remediation in this recommendation apply to bash and shell. If other
       shells are supported on the system, it is recommended that their configuration files
       are also checked. Other methods of setting a timeout exist for other shells not
       covered here.
   •   The TMOUT option applies to the active shell only. In case a user switches from one
       shell to another, it needs another full cycle to close the remaining shell.
   •   /etc/profile may get updated by YaST2 Online Update
   •   Ensure that the timeout conforms to your local policy.
                                                                                   464 | P a g e
Audit:

Run the following commands to verify that TMOUT is configured to include a timeout of no
more than 900 seconds, to be readonly, and to be exported:
Run the following command to verify that TMOUT is configured in: a .sh file in
/etc/profile.d/:

# for f in /etc/profile.d/*.sh ; do grep -Eq
'(^|^[^#]*;)\s*(readonly|export(\s+[^$#;]+\s*)*)?\s*TMOUT=(900|[1-8][0-9][0-
9]|[1-9][0-9]|[1-9])\b' $f && grep -Eq '(^|^[^#]*;)\s*readonly\s+TMOUT\b' $f
&& grep -Eq '(^|^[^#]*;)\s*export\s+([^$#;]+\s+)*TMOUT\b' $f && echo "TMOUT
correctly configured in file: $f"; done

TMOUT correctly configured in file: <name of file where TMOUT is configured>

Run the following command to verify that TMOUT is not set to a longer timeout:

# grep -PR '^\s*([^$#;]+\s+)*TMOUT=(9[0-9][1-9]|0+|[1-
9]\d{3,})\b\s*(\S+\s*)*(\s+#.*)?$' /etc/profile* /etc/bashrc.bashrc*

Nothing should be returned

Remediation:

Review /etc/bash.bashrc, /etc/profile, and all files ending in *.sh in the
/etc/profile.d/ directory and remove or edit all TMOUT=_n_ entries to follow local site
policy. TMOUT should not exceed 900 or be equal to 0.
Configure TMOUT in a file ending in .sh in the /etc/profile.d/ directory.
TMOUT configuration examples:

   •     As multiple lines:

TMOUT=900
readonly TMOUT
export TMOUT


   •     As a single line:

readonly TMOUT=900 ; export TMOUT

5.4.5 Ensure default user umask is configured (Automated)
Profile Applicability:

• Level 1 - Server
• Level 1 - Workstation

Description:

The user file-creation mode mask (umask) is used to determine the file permission for
newly created directories and files. In Linux, the default permissions for any newly created
directory is 0777 (rwxrwxrwx), and for any newly created file it is 0666 (rw-rw-rw-). The
umask modifies the default Linux permissions by restricting (masking) these permissions.
The umask is not simply subtracted, but is processed bitwise. Bits set in the umask are
cleared in the resulting file mode.

   •   The user creating the directories or files has the discretion of changing the
       permissions by:
           o Issuing the chmod command
           o Choosing a different default umask
           o Adding the umask command into a User Shell Configuration File, (
               .bash_profile or .bashrc), in their home directory
   •   The permissions listed are not masked by umask. ie a umask set by umask
       u=rwx,g=rx,o= is the Symbolic equivalent of the Octal umask 027. This umask would
       set a newly created directory with file mode drwxr-x--- and a newly created file
       with file mode rw-r-----.
   •   umask can be set with either octal or Symbolic values:
           o Octal (Numeric) Value - Represented by either three or four digits. ie umask
               0027 or umask 027. If a four digit umask is used, the first digit is ignored. The
               remaining three digits effect the resulting permissions for user, group, and
               world/other respectively.
           o Symbolic Value - Represented by a comma separated list for User u, group g,
               and world/other o.

System Wide Shell Configuration Files:

   •   /etc/profile - used to set system wide environmental variables on users shells.
       The variables are sometimes the same ones that are in the .bash_profile, however
       this file is used to set an initial PATH or PS1 for all shell users of the system. is only
       executed for interactive login shells, or shells executed with the --login
       parameter.
   •   /etc/profile.d - /etc/profile will execute the scripts within
       /etc/profile.d/*.sh. It is recommended to place your configuration in a shell
       script within /etc/profile.d to set your own system wide environmental variables.
   •   /etc/bash.bashrc - System wide version of .bashrc. etc/bashrc also invokes
       /etc/profile.d/*.sh if non-login shell, but redirects output to /dev/null if non-

                                                                                   467 | P a g e
       interactive. Is only executed for interactive shells or if BASH_ENV is set to
       /etc/bashrc.

User Shell Configuration Files:

   •   ~/.bash_profile - Is executed to configure your shell before the initial command
       prompt. Is only read by login shells.
   •   ~/.bashrc - Is executed for interactive shells. only read by a shell that's both
       interactive and non-login

Rationale:

Setting a secure default value for umask ensures that users make a conscious choice about
their file permissions. A permissive umask value could result in directories or files with
excessive permissions that can be read and/or written to by unauthorized users.
Notes:

   •   The audit and remediation in this recommendation apply to bash and shell. If other
       shells are supported on the system, it is recommended that their configuration files
       also are checked.
   •   Other methods of setting a default user umask exist.
   •   If other methods are in use in your environment they should be audited and the shell
       configs should be verified to not override.




                                                                                468 | P a g e
Audit:

Run the following commands to verify:

   •
         umask 027 or umask u=rwx,g=rx,o= or more restrictive
   •     No System Wide umask is set that allows for:
            o A newly created directories's permissions to be less restrictive than 750
               (drwxr-x---)
            o  A newly created file's permissions to be less restrictive than 640 (rw-r-----).
   •     The default System Wide umask is set to enforce:
            o A newly created directories's permissions to be 750 (drwxr-x---)
            o A newly created file's permissions be 640 (rw-r-----).

Run the following commands to verify if umask is set, it is less restrictive than 027,
u=rwx,g=rx,o=:

# grep -RPi '(^|^[^#]*)\s*umask\s+([0-7][0-7][01][0-7]\b|[0-7][0-7][0-7][0-

No file should be returned - May return "No such file or directory"

Run the following command to verify that a System Wide default umask of 027,
u=rwx,g=rx,o=, or more restrictive is set:

# grep -REi '^\s*UMASK\s+\s*(0[0-7][2-7]7|[0-7][2-

Remediation:

Configure umask in one of the following locations:

   •
        /etc/login.defs - Recommended
   •    A file ending in .sh in the /etc/profile.d/ directory
   •
        /etc/default/login

        /etc/profile.local
   •
        /etc/profile - This is not recommended, may be updated/overwritten by YaST2
        Online Update

Example:
edit /etc/login.defs and add or modify the UMASK line.

UMASK 027

Review files ending in .sh in the /etc/profile.d/ directory, and the files;
/etc/bash.bashrc, /etc/profile, and /etc/profile.local. Remove or edit all umask
entries to follow local site policy. Any remaining entries should be: umask 027, umask
u=rwx,g=rx,o= or more restrictive.

5.6 Ensure access to the su command is restricted (Automated)
Profile Applicability:

• Level 1 - Server
• Level 1 - Workstation

Description:

The su command allows a user to run a command or shell as another user. The program
has been superseded by sudo, which allows for more granular control over privileged
access. Normally, the su command can be executed by any user. By uncommenting the
pam_wheel.so statement in /etc/pam.d/su, the su command will only allow users in a
specific groups to execute su. This group should be empty to reinforce the use of sudo for
privileged access.

Rationale:

Restricting the use of su , and using sudo in its place, provides system administrators better
control of the escalation of user privileges to execute privileged commands. The sudo utility
also provides a better logging and audit mechanism, as it can log each command executed
via sudo , whereas su can only record that a user executed the su program.

Audit:

Run the following command and verify the output matches the line:

# grep -E
'^\s*auth\s+required\s+pam_wheel\.so\s+(\S+\s+)*use_uid\s+(\S+\s+)*group=\S+\
s*(\S+\s*)*(\s+#.*)?$' /etc/pam.d/su

auth required pam_wheel.so use_uid group=<group_name>

Run the following command and verify that the group specified in <group_name> contains
no users:

# grep <group_name> /etc/group

<group_name>:x:<GID>:

There should be no users listed after the Group ID field.




                                                                                472 | P a g e
Remediation:

Create an empty group that will be specified for use of the su command. The group should
be named according to site policy.
Example

# groupadd sugroup

Add the following line to the /etc/pam.d/su file, specifying the empty group:

6.1 System File Permissions
This section provides guidance on securing aspects of system files and directories.




                                                                               475 | P a g e
6.1.1 Audit system file permissions (Manual)
Profile Applicability:

• Level 2 - Server
• Level 2 - Workstation

Description:

The RPM package manager has a number of useful options. One of these, the -V option, can
be used to verify that system packages are correctly installed. The V option can be used to
verify a particular package or to verify all system packages. If no output is returned, the
package is installed correctly. The following table describes the meaning of output from the
verify option:

Code    Meaning

S       File size differs.

M       File mode differs (includes permissions and file type).

5       The MD5 checksum differs.

D       The major and minor version numbers differ on a device file.

L       A mismatch occurs in a link.

U       The file ownership differs.

G       The file group owner differs.

T       The file time (mtime) differs.

The rpm -qf command can be used to determine which package a particular file belongs to.
For example the following commands determines which package the
/etc/ssh/sshd_config file belongs to:

# rpm -qf /etc/ssh/sshd_config



openssh-7.9p1-6.14.1.x86_64

To verify the settings for the package that controls the /etc/ssh/sshd_config file, run the
following:

# rpm -V openssh-7.9p1-6.14.1.x86_64



S.5....T.    c /etc/ssh/sshd_config


                                                                               476 | P a g e
Note: You can feed the output of the rpm -qf command to the rpm -V command:

#   rpm -V $(rpm -qf /etc/ssh/sshd_config)



S.5....T.      c /etc/ssh/sshd_config

Notes:

    •    Since packages and important files may change with new updates and releases, it is
         recommended to verify everything, not just a finite list of files. This can be a time
         consuming task and results may depend on site policy therefore it is not a scorable
         benchmark item, but is provided for those interested in additional security measures.
    •    Some of the recommendations of this benchmark alter the state of files audited by this
         recommendation. The audit command will alert for all changes to a file permissions
         even if the new state is more secure than the default.

Rationale:

It is important to confirm that packaged system files and directories are maintained with
the permissions they were intended to have from the OS distributor or in accordance with
local site policy.

Audit:

Run the following command to review all installed packages. Note that this may be very
time consuming and may be best scheduled via the cron utility. It is recommended that the
output of this command be redirected to a file that can be reviewed later. This command
will ignore configuration files due to the extreme likelihood that they will change.

# rpm -Va --nomtime --nosize --nomd5 --nolinkto > <filename> | grep -vw c

Remediation:

Investigate the results to ensure any discrepancies found are understood and support
proper secure operation of the system.

6.1.2 Ensure permissions on /etc/passwd are configured (Automated)
Profile Applicability:

• Level 1 - Server
• Level 1 - Workstation

Description:

The /etc/passwd file contains user account information that is used by many system
utilities and therefore must be readable for these utilities to operate.

Rationale:

It is critical to ensure that the /etc/passwd file is protected from unauthorized write
access. Although it is protected by default, the file permissions could be changed either
inadvertently or through malicious actions.

Audit:

Run the following command and verify Uid and Gid are both 0/root and Access is 644 or
more restrictive:

# stat /etc/passwd

Access: (0644/-rw-r--r--)                Uid: (           0/        root)        Gid: (            0/         root)

Remediation:

Run the following commands to set owner, group, and permissions on /etc/passwd:

# chown root:root /etc/passwd

# chmod u-x,g-wx,o-wx /etc/passwd

6.1.3 Ensure permissions on /etc/shadow are configured (Automated)
Profile Applicability:

• Level 1 - Server
• Level 1 - Workstation

Description:

The /etc/shadow file is used to store the information about user accounts that is critical to
the security of those accounts, such as the hashed password and other security
information.

Rationale:

If attackers can gain read access to the /etc/shadow file, they can easily run a password
cracking program against the hashed password to break it. Other security information that
is stored in the /etc/shadow file (such as expiration) could also be useful to subvert the
user accounts.

Audit:

Run the following command and verify Uid is 0/root, Gid is 0/root or <gid> /shadow, and
Access is 0640 or more restrictive:

# stat /etc/shadow

Access: (0640/-rw-r-----)                Uid: (           0/        root)         Gid: (         15/     shadow)

6.1.4 Ensure permissions on /etc/group are configured (Automated)
Profile Applicability:

• Level 1 - Server
• Level 1 - Workstation

Description:

The /etc/group file contains a list of all the valid groups defined in the system. The
command below allows read/write access for root and read access for everyone else.

Rationale:

The /etc/group file needs to be protected from unauthorized changes by non-privileged
users, but needs to be readable as this information is used with many non-privileged
programs.

Audit:

Run the following command and verify Uid and Gid are both 0/root and Access is 644 or
more restrictive:

# stat /etc/group

Access: (0644/-rw-r--r--)                Uid: (           0/        root)         Gid: (           0/         root)

World writable files may also indicate an incorrectly written script or program that could
potentially be the cause of a larger compromise to the system's integrity.

Audit:

Run the following command and verify no files are returned:

# df --local -P | awk '{if (NR!=1) print $6}' | xargs -I '{}' find '{}' -xdev
-type f -perm -0002

The command above only searches local filesystems, there may still be compromised items
on network mounted partitions. Additionally the --local option to df is not universal to all
versions, it can be omitted to search all filesystems on a system including network mounted
filesystems or the following command can be run manually for each partition:

# find <partition> -xdev -type f -perm -0002

Remediation:

Removing write access for the "other" category ( chmod o-w <filename> ) is advisable, but
always consult relevant vendor documentation to avoid breaking any application
dependencies on a given file.

6.1.11 Audit SUID executables (Manual)
Profile Applicability:

• Level 1 - Server

Description:

The owner of a file can set the file's permissions to run with the owner's or group's
permissions, even if the user running the program is not the owner or a member of the
group. The most common reason for a SUID program is to enable users to perform
functions (such as changing their password) that require root privileges.

Rationale:

There are valid reasons for SUID programs, but it is important to identify and review such
programs to ensure they are legitimate.

Audit:

Run the following command to list SUID files:

# df --local -P | awk '{if (NR!=1) print $6}' | xargs -I '{}' find '{}' -xdev
-type f -perm -4000

The command above only searches local filesystems, there may still be compromised items

Description:

The owner of a file can set the file's permissions to run with the owner's or group's
permissions, even if the user running the program is not the owner or a member of the

functions (such as changing their password) that require root privileges.

Rationale:

There are valid reasons for SGID programs, but it is important to identify and review such
programs to ensure they are legitimate. Review the files returned by the action in the audit
section and check to see if system binaries have a different md5 checksum than what from
the package. This is an indication that the binary may have been replaced.

Run the following command to list SGID files:

# df --local -P | awk '{if (NR!=1) print $6}' | xargs -I '{}' find '{}' -xdev

6.2.1 Ensure accounts in /etc/passwd use shadowed passwords
(Automated)
Profile Applicability:

• Level 1 - Server
• Level 1 - Workstation

Description:

Local accounts can uses shadowed passwords. With shadowed passwords, The passwords
are saved in shadow password file, /etc/shadow, encrypted by a salted one-way hash.
Accounts with a shadowed password have an x in the second field in /etc/passwd.

Rationale:

The /etc/passwd file also contains information like user ID's and group ID's that are used
by many system programs. Therefore, the /etc/passwd file must remain world readable. In
spite of encoding the password with a randomly-generated one-way hash function, an
attacker could still break the system if they got access to the /etc/passwd file. This can be
mitigated by using shadowed passwords, thus moving the passwords in the /etc/passwd
file to /etc/shadow. The /etc/shadow file is set so only root will be able to read and write.
This helps mitigate the risk of an attacker gaining access to the encoded passwords with
which to perform a dictionary attack.

Notes:

   •     All accounts must have passwords or be locked to prevent the account from being used
         by an unauthorized user.
   •     A user account with an empty second field in /etc/passwd allows the account to be
         logged into by providing only the username.

Audit:

Run the following command and verify that no output is returned:

# awk -F: '($2 != "x" ) { print $1 " is not set to shadowed passwords "}'
/etc/passwd




                                                                                496 | P a g e
Remediation:

If any accounts in the /etc/passwd file do not have a single x in the password field, run the
following command to set these accounts to use shadowed passwords:

# sed -e 's/^\([a-zA-Z0-9_]*\):[^:]*:/\1:x:/' -i /etc/passwd

Investigate to determine if the account is logged in and what it is being used for, to
determine if it needs to be forced off.

6.2.4 Ensure root PATH Integrity (Automated)
Profile Applicability:

• Level 1 - Server
• Level 1 - Workstation

Description:

The root user can execute any command on the system and could be fooled into executing
programs unintentionally if the PATH is not set correctly.

Rationale:

Including the current working directory (.) or other writable directory in root 's executable
path makes it likely that an attacker can gain superuser access by forcing an administrator
operating as root to execute a Trojan horse program.

Audit:

Run the following script and verify no results are returned:

#!/bin/bash

if echo "$PATH" | grep -q "::" ; then
    echo "Empty Directory in PATH (::)"
fi
if echo "$PATH" | grep -q ":$" ; then
          echo "Trailing : in PATH"
fi
for x in $(echo "$PATH" | tr ":" " ") ; do
   if [ -d "$x" ] ; then
      ls -ldH "$x" | awk '
$9 == "." {print "PATH contains current working directory (.)"}
$3 != "root" {print $9, "is not owned by root"}
substr($1,6,1) != "-" {print $9, "is group writable"}
substr($1,9,1) != "-" {print $9, "is world writable"}'

6.2.5 Ensure all users' home directories exist (Automated)
Profile Applicability:

• Level 1 - Server
• Level 1 - Workstation

Description:

Users can be defined in /etc/passwd without a home directory or with a home directory
that does not actually exist.

Rationale:

If the user's home directory does not exist or is unassigned, the user will be placed in "/"
and will not be able to write any files or have local environment variables set.

Audit:

Run the following script and verify no results are returned:

#!/bin/bash

grep -E -v '^(halt|sync|shutdown)' /etc/passwd | awk -F: '($7 != "'"$(which
nologin)"'" && $7 != "/bin/false") { print $1 " " $6 }' | while read -r user
dir; do
        if [ ! -d "$dir" ]; then
                echo "The home directory ($dir) of user $user does not exist."
        fi
done

Note: The audit script checks all users with interactive shells except halt, sync, shutdown, and
nfsnobody.

Remediation:

If any users' home directories do not exist, create them and make sure the respective user
owns the directory. Users without an assigned home directory should be removed or
assigned a home directory as appropriate.

6.2.6 Ensure users' home directories permissions are 750 or more
restrictive (Automated)
Profile Applicability:

• Level 1 - Server
• Level 1 - Workstation

Description:

While the system administrator can establish secure permissions for users' home
directories, the users can easily override these.

Rationale:

Group or world-writable user home directories may enable malicious users to steal or
modify other users' data or to gain another user's system privileges.

6.2.7 Ensure users own their home directories (Automated)
Profile Applicability:

• Level 1 - Server
• Level 1 - Workstation

Description:

The user home directory is space defined for the particular user to set local environment
variables and to store personal files.

Rationale:

Since the user is accountable for files stored in the user home directory, the user must be
the owner of the directory.

Audit:

Run the following script and verify no results are returned:

#!/bin/bash

grep -E -v '^(halt|sync|shutdown)' /etc/passwd | awk -F: '($7 != "'"$(which

Profile Applicability:

• Level 1 - Server

Description:

While the system administrator can establish secure permissions for users' .netrc files, the
users can easily override these.

Rationale:

.netrc files may contain unencrypted passwords that may be used to attack other systems.

Note: While the complete removal of .netrc files is recommended if any are required on the
system secure permissions must be applied.

Description:

While no .rhosts files are shipped by default, users can easily create them.

Rationale:

This action is only meaningful if .rhosts support is permitted in the file /etc/pam.conf .

Description:

Over time, system administration errors and changes can lead to groups being defined in

Description:

Although the useradd program will not let you create a duplicate User ID (UID), it is

Profile Applicability:

Description:

Although the useradd program will not let you create a duplicate user name, it is possible
for an administrator to manually edit the /etc/passwd file and change the user name.

Rationale:

If a user is assigned a duplicate user name, it will create and have access to files with the
first UID for that username in /etc/passwd .

Example: If "test4" has a UID of 1000 and a subsequent "test4" entry has a UID of 2000,
logging in as "test4" will use UID 1000. Effectively, the UID is shared, which is a security
problem

6.2.18 Ensure shadow group is empty (Automated)
Profile Applicability:

• Level 1 - Server
• Level 1 - Workstation

Description:

The shadow group allows system programs which require access the ability to read the
/etc/shadow file. No users should be assigned to the shadow group.

Rationale:

Any users assigned to the shadow group would be granted read access to the /etc/shadow
file. If attackers can gain read access to the /etc/shadow file, they can easily run a password
cracking program against the hashed passwords to break them. Other security information
that is stored in the /etc/shadow file (such as expiration) could also be useful to subvert
additional user accounts.

Audit:

Run the following commands and verify no results are returned:

# grep ^shadow:[^:]*:[^:]*:[^:]+ /etc/group
